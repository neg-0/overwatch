INDOPACOM — WESTERN PACIFIC
SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS (SPINS)
Air Operations — Exercise Simulation Only
Classification: SIMULATION / FOR EXERCISE USE ONLY
Effective: Exercise Start Date — Exercise End Date
Authority: Joint Force Air Component Commander (JFACC) / Combined Air Operations Center (CAOC)

NOTE: This SPINS document is for training and simulation purposes only. All coordinates, frequencies, codes, and unit names marked with brackets or “(SIM)” are exercise placeholders and must be validated against live exercise orders, air tasking orders (ATO), and CAOC releases prior to flight. Do not employ against real-world targets or in live operations.

1. GENERAL
1.1 Purpose. Provide standing instructions for all coalition and participating aircrews operating in the INDOPACOM — Western Pacific theater during the exercise. Ensure compliance with theater RoE, Positive Identification (PID) standards, civilian casualty avoidance (CCOA), and risk mitigation.
1.2 Theater Rules of Engagement (RoE) Summary (simulation).
  a. Defensive Fires Only: Use of force authorized to counter hostile act or demonstrated hostile intent directed against forces, assets, or identified civilians per ROE Annex. Proportionality and discrimination must be applied.
  b. Weapons Release Authority: Aircrew will not employ lethal munitions without pre-coordinated weapons release authority (WRA) from the CAOC or delegated Strike Authority (for time-sensitive targets, pre-designated TST authority will be published in the ATO).
  c. De-escalation: Warning measures (visual, radio, flares) shall be used when practicable before lethal force.
  d. No-strike Lists (NSL) and Positive Identification Lists (PID-L): CAOC will publish updated NSL and PID-L daily in the ATO and ATO supplements.
1.3 Positive Identification (PID) Requirements.
  a. PID Standard: Positive identification requires two independent PID means when practical (RADAR/EO/IR/visual/ID friend or foe). Single-source PID allowed only under pre-authorized emergency conditions and with higher authority concurrence.
  b. Aircraft vs. Maritime/Surface: Visual or EO confirmation required for surface targets in maritime littoral zones; radar track correlations alone insufficient within 50 nm of high-density shipping lanes.
  c. PID Hold Time: Hold fires for minimum of 2 minutes to attempt communication and challenge unless immediate self-defense is required.
1.4 Civilian Casualty Avoidance (CCOA)/Collateral Damage Estimate (CDE) Requirements.
  a. Pre-strike Planning: All strike packages must submit CDE estimates to CAOC targeting cell for automated deconfliction and approval. Minimum required CDE components include collateral estimates, civilian proximity, and civilian critical infrastructure.
  b. Dynamic Engagements: If civilian presence is suspected, shift to precision-guided munitions (PGMs) or abort if risk cannot be mitigated.
  c. Human Shields: Evidence of coercion must be documented; legal counsel in CAOC to be consulted prior to engagement where feasible.
1.5 Risk Mitigation.
  a. EMCON: Joint EMCON levels published daily. COMMS silence exceptions must be authorized.
  b. Air Refueling and Basing: Alternate recovery fields published in ATO. Night operations over maritime transit corridors require CAP support.
  c. Electronic Warfare (EW) Mitigation: Units must brief GPS-denial contingencies; inertial navigation backup required for all strike and ISR aircraft.

2. AIRSPACE CONTROL
2.1 Deconfliction by Altitude and Mission Type (standard theater blocks — exercise).
  a. Air-to-Air Combat Air Patrol (CAP): FL250–FL350 unless otherwise assigned.
  b. Strike/SEAD/DEAD: FL200–FL300 for ingress/egress; weapons release profiles per weapons brief.
  c. ISR/Reconnaissance: FL300–FL600 depending on platform; low-level tactical drone operations authorized below FL200 in designated UAS corridors.
  d. AEW/C2: FL300–FL400 as directed.

4.4 Survivor Authentication Codes.
  a. Initial Survivors: Pre-designated authentication phrases and one-time visual cues (IR strobe pattern — 3 long pulses every 30 sec) issued pre-mission.
  b. Dynamic Changes: If suspect of compromise, survivors will use override phrase and secondary IR signature; controllers will initiate verification intercept procedures.
4.5 CSAR Execution Constraints.
  a. Denied Area Recovery: Denied-area recoveries require explicit approval from JFACC and JSOTF (for joint exercises). Rescue packages will consider SEAD/DEAD support or use of TST pathways.

5. SPACE SUPPORT
5.1 GPS Degradation Warnings and Contingency Procedures.

7. WEATHER MINIMUMS
7.1 Strike (Fixed-Wing, High-Altitude).
