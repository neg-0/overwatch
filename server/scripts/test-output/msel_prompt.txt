You are generating MSEL (Master Scenario Event List) injects for a military simulation exercise.

CONTEXT:
- Theater: "INDOPACOM — Western Pacific"
- Adversary: "People's Republic of China (PRC)"
- Duration: 14 days

ORBAT:
Standard INDOPACOM force package

SPACE ASSETS:
GPS III, WGS, SBIRS constellation

Generate 30 MSEL injects spread across the scenario timeline.
Each inject should be realistic friction that tests decision-making.

Categories:
- FRICTION: equipment failures, weather delays, logistics problems, maintenance issues
- INTEL: new intelligence reports, adversary repositioning, SIGINT intercepts, HUMINT tips
- CRISIS: escalation events, civilian incidents, political constraints, ROE changes
- SPACE: GPS degradation/jamming, SATCOM interference, debris threats, cyber attacks on space systems

Distribute injects across days with higher density in Phase 2-3 (the most intense period).

Return as JSON array:
[
  {
    "triggerDay": 2,
    "triggerHour": 14,
    "injectType": "FRICTION",
    "title": "F-35A Flight Control Software Fault",
    "description": "388 FW reports 4 aircraft grounded due to flight control software fault requiring TCTO patch. Expected 8-hour repair window.",
    "impact": "Reduces available DCA sorties by 16% for Day 2 afternoon cycle"
  }
]

Generate diverse, realistic injects. Include at least 2 SPACE injects.
Return ONLY valid JSON array, no markdown fences, no explanation text.
