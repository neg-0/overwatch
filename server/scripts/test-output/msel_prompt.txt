You are a senior Exercise Control Group (EXCON) planner creating a Master Scenario Events List (MSEL) per CJCSM 3500.03F for a joint military exercise.

CONTEXT:
- Theater: "INDOPACOM — Western Pacific"
- Adversary: "People's Republic of China (PRC)"
- Exercise duration: 14 days (2026-03-01T00:00:00Z to 2026-03-15T00:00:00Z)
- Campaign phases: Phase 0 (Day 1), Phase 1 (Days 2-3), Phase 2 (Days 4-7), Phase 3 (Days 8-11), Phase 4 (Days 12-14)

ORBAT:
Standard INDOPACOM force package: 2x fighter wings (F-35A, F-16C), 1x carrier strike group, 1x destroyer squadron, 1x submarine squadron

SPACE ASSETS:
GPS III (6 SVs), WGS (3 SVs), AEHF (2 SVs), MUOS (2 SVs), SBIRS GEO (2 SVs)

Generate a complete MSEL document in official EXCON format.

FORMAT REQUIREMENTS (per CJCSM 3500.03F):

1. Start with a HEADER BLOCK:
   - Document title: "MASTER SCENARIO EVENTS LIST (MSEL)"
   - Exercise/Operation name
   - EXCON issuing authority
   - Classification
   - Effective period
   - References (CJCSM 3500.03F, JP 3-0, JP 5-0)

2. Then a PIPE-DELIMITED TABLE with these exact column headers:
SERIAL | DTG | LEVEL | TYPE | MODE | FROM | TO | MESSAGE | EXPECTED RESPONSE | OBJECTIVE | NOTES

Column definitions:
- SERIAL: Sequential number (001, 002, 003...)
- DTG: Date-Time Group in military format (DDHHMMz MON YY, e.g., "011000Z MAR 26")
- LEVEL: MSEL level per CJCSM 3500.03F:
    STR-N = Strategic National
    STR-T = Strategic Theater
    OPR = Operational
    TAC = Tactical
- TYPE: Event type:
    INFORMATION = Intel/SIGINT/HUMINT reports, situational updates
    ACTION = Equipment failures, weather events, logistics friction
    DECISION_POINT = Escalation events requiring commander decision
    CONTINGENCY = Political constraints, ROE changes, civilian incidents
- MODE: How the inject is delivered to the training audience:
    MSG_TRAFFIC = Message traffic / operational reporting
    RADIO = Radio call / voice comms
    EMAIL = Email / digital message
    VERBAL = In-person verbal briefing
    HANDOUT = Written handout / hard copy
    CHAT = Chat / instant messaging
- FROM: Originator entity (e.g., "EXCON SimCell", "INDOPACOM J2", "613 AOC", "CSG-5 OPS")
- TO: Recipient entity (e.g., "JFACC", "JFLCC", "JSpOC", "CFMCC", "JIATF CDR")
- MESSAGE: The actual inject message as it would be delivered (realistic operational language)
- EXPECTED RESPONSE: What the training audience should do in response
- OBJECTIVE: Exercise objective or UJTL task being tested (e.g., "OP 5.1 - Air Superiority", "ST 3.2 - C2")
- NOTES: Controller guidance, timing flexibility, evaluation criteria

3. Generate 30 injects distributed across the 14-day timeline:
   - Phase 0 (Day 1): 2-3 injects (shape/posture)
   - Phase 1 (Days 2-3): 4-5 injects (deterrence)
   - Phase 2 (Days 4-7): 10-12 injects (highest intensity)
   - Phase 3 (Days 8-11): 8-10 injects (dominate)
   - Phase 4 (Days 12-14): 3-5 injects (stabilize)

4. Include these inject categories with roughly this distribution:
   - INFORMATION: ~30% (SIGINT, HUMINT, ISR imagery, open-source intel)
   - ACTION: ~30% (equipment failures, weather, logistics, maintenance)
   - DECISION_POINT: ~20% (escalation events requiring commander decision)
   - CONTINGENCY: ~20% (political constraints, ROE changes, civilian incidents)
   - At least 4 must involve space systems (GPS, SATCOM, OPIR, space debris, cyber)

5. Include multiple MSEL levels (STR-T, OPR, TAC).

6. Use realistic military terminology, unit designations, frequency references, and grid coordinates.

Return ONLY the MSEL document text. No JSON. No markdown fences. No explanation text before or after.
