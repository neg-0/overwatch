Tanker-to-receiver communications require positive identification, bingo fuel checks every 15 minutes.\n\n4. COMBAT AIR PATROL (CAP) STATIONS\nCAPs are established for air defense of key assets and to provide fighter escort during strike packages. CAPs will perform handoff per the Theater Handoff Matrix and use assigned control frequencies.\n\nCAP-ALPHA (Carrier Battle Group Defense)\n- Station: Orbit centered 21°00.00'N, 125°45.00'E (SIM) — circular 30 NM radius.\n- Altitude Block: FL200–FL300.\n- Assigned Units: USS SIM-CV-1 Air Wing (F/A-18E/F), JASDF Fighter Squadron Detachment (F-2) (SIM).\n- Handoff Procedures: Control begins with Carrier Air Traffic Control (CATCC) within 60 NM. At 60 NM from carrier, control transferred to CFAC Air Defense (SIM-FREQ-CAP-A). Positive control requires Mode 4/5/S IFF, discrete authentication challenge per Exercise IFF Table.\n- ROE: Intercept procedure per Exercise Intercept Profile; use minimum necessary force. Engagement of simulated adversary only with positive ID and ROE authorization.\n\nCAP-BRAVO (Fixed-Base Airfield Defense)\n- Station: 24°00.00'N, 127°00.00'E (SIM) — 15 NM orbit.\n- Altitude Block: Surface to FL250 (primary CAP FL080–FL160).\n- Assigned Units: RAAF/USAF Combined Squadron (F-35A) (SIM).\n- Handoff Procedures: Local tower coordinates vector-to-intercept; transfer to CFAC at IAW Handoff Matrix.\n\n5. TRANSIT CORRIDORS\nDesignated air corridors provide safe transit for non-combat and transit missions. Strict altitude, IFF, and communication requirements are enforced.\n\nCORRIDOR-1 “SOUTHERN PASS”\n- Entry Point: 17°30.00'N, 126°00.00'E.\n- Exit Point: 20°00.00'N, 129°00.00'E.\n- Width: 25 NM corridor centered on track.\n- Altitude Assignment: Odd flight levels (FL190–FL290) for eastbound; Even flight levels (FL180–FL280) for westbound to maintain vertical separation.\n- IFF Procedures: All corridor traffic must operate Mode 3/A and Mode S; Mode 5 preferred. Failure to comply constitutes immediate escort by CAP and possible diversion.\n- Communications: Monitor SIM-FREQ-TRANS-1; file flight plan with CACE 2 hours prior to entry.\n\nCORRIDOR-2 “STRAITS LANE”\n- Entry Point: 22°45.00'N, 130°15.00'E.\n- Exit Point: 24°15.00'N, 127°45.00'E.\n- Width: 15 NM.\n- Altitude Assignment: Reserved FL120–FL180 for low transit; FL220–FL300 for high transit; direction assigns as per NOTAM-SIM.\n- Special Procedures: All transit aircraft must squawk assigned discrete codes. Unannounced deviations will trigger HIDACZ intercept.\n\n6. KILL BOXES\nKill boxes provide pre-coordinated airspace where attack aircraft and fire support units may engage simulated targets with reduced coordination measures while maintaining deconfliction. Use GARS (Global Area Reference System) grid references followed by engagement rules.\n\nKILLBOX-KB1 “EAST GARS-3419”\n- GARS: 3419 (SIM).\n- Boundaries: GARS cell 3419 as depicted in exercise map pack.\n- Altitude Block: Surface to FL250.\n- Engagement Rules: Type II (Aviation and Surface Fires permitted).

Ground and maritime units must report simulated signature emissions prior to missions.\n9.2 Friendly-Force Tracking (FFT). FFT is provided by CFAC Combined Track Picture (SIM-CTP). All participants must report takeoff/landing and mission status updates to SIM-CTP on SIM-FREQ-FFT. Loss of track must be reported immediately; MRRs and HIDACZ procedures apply to re-establish positive identification.\n9.3 Authentication. Authentication challenges per Exercise Authentication Table (Annex AUTH). Challenge-response required during CAP handoffs and for transit corridor entry.\n\n10. COMMUNICATIONS AND FREQUENCIES\n10.1 Primary Exercise Frequencies (SIM). All units must validate SIM frequencies before operations:\n- SIM-FREQ-CACE-COM: 251.400 SIM\n- SIM-FREQ-AR-BLUE: 265.200 SIM\n- SIM-FREQ-AR-GREEN: 267.000 SIM\n- SIM-FREQ-CAP-A: 223.150 SIM\n- SIM-FREQ-TRANS-1: 243.050 SIM\n- SIM-FREQ-KILLBOX-KB1: 216.600 SIM\n- SIM-FREQ-KILLBOX-KB2: 218.800 SIM\n- SIM-FREQ-HIDACZ-CTR: 277.900 SIM\n- SIM-FREQ-FFT: 241.700 SIM\n10.2 Guard and Emergency. All units monitor SIM-FREQ-GUARD: 243.000 SIM. Medical emergency monitor SIM-FREQ-MED: 254.300 SIM.\n10.3 Data Links. Simulated Link-16 (TADIL-J-SIM) will be used for track dissemination where authorized. Units without Link-16 must coordinate for periodic updates via voice.\n\n11. DECONFLICTION PROCEDURES\n11.1 Vertical Deconfliction. Use published altitude blocks for ARTs, CAPs, ROZs, transit corridors, and kill boxes. Minimum vertical separation in shared altitudes is 1,000 ft up to FL290; 2,000 ft above FL290 unless under positive control.\n11.2 Lateral/Temporal Deconfliction. Sequencing windows for HIDACZ and MRR are assigned by CACE. Where conflicting missions are planned, the higher-priority mission per JTF Commander’s mission list receives precedence; lower-priority missions must re-route or reschedule.\n11.3 Electronic Warfare Deconfliction. EW sorties in ROZ-02 will publish emissions schedule 24 hours in advance. All friendly platforms will be issued EW effect boundaries and mandated to carry an EW safe distance buffer of 15 NM unless otherwise coordinated.\n11.4 Air-to-Air and Surface Fire Deconfliction. Kill box activation and FSCL entry procedures mandatory. Fire support liaison (FSL) will ensure all surface-to-surface and surface-to-air simulated fires are recorded and broadcast.\n11.5 Emergency Procedures. Lost communications: squawk 7600, proceed along MRR if in transit or orbit at last assigned altitude for CAP. Mayday/cant locate: all CAPs and tankers monitor SIM-FREQ-GUARD and assist as tasked by CACE.\n\n12. TARGETING AND SIMULATED ENGAGEMENT RULES\n12.1 Simulated Target Sets. Target sets replicate adversary PRC simulated assets (SIM-OPFOR) including SAM emplacements, simulated SLOC interdiction vessels, and simulated ISR nodes. Specific target grids are published in Exercise Target Annex (SIM-TGT).\n12.2 Simulated Weapons Effects. All weapon delivery will be simulated with adjudication by Exercise Control (EXCON). Live munitions are not used. All strikes require pre-briefed and EXCON-approved attack deconfliction times.\n12.3 Engagement Authority. Simulated Weapons Release Authority rests with JTF-PS Combined Fires Authority (CFA) per Exercise ROE. Immediate self-defense allowed for simulated hostile actions per ROE.\n\n13. ATTACHMENTS AND ANNEXES\n13.1 Annex Frequencies: detailed frequency list and guard channels.\n13.2 Annex Handoff Matrix: procedures for handoff among CATCC, CFAC, CMCF, JASU, and local towers.\n13.3 Annex Target Allocation: simulated target list and priority by phase.\n13.4 Annex Authentication: challenge/response tables.\n13.5 Exercise Maps: graphical depiction of ROZs, ARTs, CAP areas, corridors, kill boxes, HIDACZ, MRRs.\n\n14. COORDINATION & REPORTING\n14.1 Pre-Mission Coordination. All strike, ISR, EW, and tanker taskings must be coordinated with CACE 24–72 hours prior to execution as applicable. Fast-time coordination windows available for emergent tasks.\n14.2 Post-Mission Reporting. All participants must submit after-action reports (AAR) to CACE within 6 hours of mission termination, including track logs, IFF status, and any deconfliction incidents.\n14.3 Incidents. Any air safety incident, near miss, or simulated fratricide will be reported immediately to CACE and EXCON. A Safety Investigation (SIM) will be convened.\n\n15. SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS (SIMULATION HIGHLIGHTS)\n15.1 Adversary (PRC-SIM) Tactics. OPFOR will employ simulated integrated air defense system (IADS) deployments in northeastern and north-central sectors, and simulated maritime harassment tactics in southern approaches. Friendly units must apply RCC (rules, cross-cueing, counter-EW) and adhere to ROZ/EW coordination.\n15.2 Coalition Integration. All coalition participants must supply unit liaison to CACE for joint track integration and abide by authentication procedures.\n15.3 Exercise Safety Limits. All participants remain subject to host-nation simulated airspace agreements and international safety minima; any deviation may cause exercise sanction.\n\n16. AMENDMENT PROCEDURE\n16.1 ACO Amendments. CACE will issue amendments via SIM-PRICE ACO Notice at least 2 hours prior to effect. Emergency amendments may be broadcast by CACE with immediate effect and will be followed by formal written update.\n16.2 Cancellation. All airspace measures terminate at end of effective period or upon formal cancellation. Units must acknowledge cancellation via SIM-FREQ-ACK.\n\n17. CERTIFICATION\nThis ACO is issued under the authority of Combined Airspace Coordination Element (CACE), JTF-PACIFIC SHIELD (SIM). All participating units must comply with the provisions contained herein and coordinate with CACE for clarifications.\n\nIssued: 0000Z 28 FEB 2026\nCombined Airspace Coordination Element (CACE)\nJoint Task Force PACIFIC SHIELD (SIM)\n\nSIMULATION DISCLAIMER: This ACO is strictly for a simulated training exercise.
