5. TRANSIT CORRIDORS
Designated air corridors provide safe transit for non-combat and transit missions. Strict altitude, IFF, and communication requirements are enforced.

CORRIDOR-1 “SOUTHERN PASS”
- Entry Point: 17°30.00'N, 126°00.00'E.
- Exit Point: 20°00.00'N, 129°00.00'E.
- Width: 25 NM corridor centered on track.
- Altitude Assignment: Odd flight levels (FL190–FL290) for eastbound; Even flight levels (FL180–FL280) for westbound to maintain vertical separation.
- IFF Procedures: All corridor traffic must operate Mode 3/A and Mode S; Mode 5 preferred. Failure to comply constitutes immediate escort by CAP and possible diversion.
- Communications: Monitor SIM-FREQ-TRANS-1; file flight plan with CACE 2 hours prior to entry.

CORRIDOR-2 “STRAITS LANE”

Air-to-surface and indirect fires permitted with requirement to broadcast munition type and planned fires on SIM-FREQ-KILLBOX-KB1 15 minutes prior to engagement. No surface-to-surface fires within 5 NM of friendly positions without Fire Support Coordination Center (FSCC) clearance.
- FSCL: Simulated FSCL-4; maximum ordnance weight-per-salvo and min-separation per Annex Fires (SIM).

KILLBOX-KB2 “WEST GARS-3521”
- GARS: 3521 (SIM).
- Altitude Block: FL150–FL450 (air-to-air engagements permitted above FL150).
- Engagement Rules: Type I (aviation-only). Aircraft may execute weapon deliveries without additional deconfliction if briefed in the strike package. All aircrew must confirm kill box activation via CACE and monitor SIM-FREQ-KILLBOX-KB2.

7. HIGH DENSITY AIRSPACE CONTROL ZONES (HIDACZ)
HIDACZs are designated where the volume of air traffic is high and detailed sequencing and control measures are required for safety.

11. DECONFLICTION PROCEDURES
11.1 Vertical Deconfliction. Use published altitude blocks for ARTs, CAPs, ROZs, transit corridors, and kill boxes. Minimum vertical separation in shared altitudes is 1,000 ft up to FL290; 2,000 ft above FL290 unless under positive control.
11.2 Lateral/Temporal Deconfliction. Sequencing windows for HIDACZ and MRR are assigned by CACE. Where conflicting missions are planned, the higher-priority mission per JTF Commander’s mission list receives precedence; lower-priority missions must re-route or reschedule.
11.3 Electronic Warfare Deconfliction. EW sorties in ROZ-02 will publish emissions schedule 24 hours in advance. All friendly platforms will be issued EW effect boundaries and mandated to carry an EW safe distance buffer of 15 NM unless otherwise coordinated.
11.4 Air-to-Air and Surface Fire Deconfliction. Kill box activation and FSCL entry procedures mandatory. Fire support liaison (FSL) will ensure all surface-to-surface and surface-to-air simulated fires are recorded and broadcast.
11.5 Emergency Procedures. Lost communications: squawk 7600, proceed along MRR if in transit or orbit at last assigned altitude for CAP. Mayday/cant locate: all CAPs and tankers monitor SIM-FREQ-GUARD and assist as tasked by CACE.

12. TARGETING AND SIMULATED ENGAGEMENT RULES
12.1 Simulated Target Sets. Target sets replicate adversary PRC simulated assets (SIM-OPFOR) including SAM emplacements, simulated SLOC interdiction vessels, and simulated ISR nodes. Specific target grids are published in Exercise Target Annex (SIM-TGT).
12.2 Simulated Weapons Effects. All weapon delivery will be simulated with adjudication by Exercise Control (EXCON). Live munitions are not used. All strikes require pre-briefed and EXCON-approved attack deconfliction times.
