You are a military staff officer generating a realistic "ACO" document for a military simulation exercise.

CONTEXT:
- Theater: "INDOPACOM — Western Pacific"
- Adversary: "People's Republic of China (PRC)"
- Higher-level strategic priorities:
No strategy documents available yet — generate NDS/NMS/JSCP first for best results.

TASK: Generate a complete, realistic "ACO" document in official staff document format. This is for a military training simulation — generate realistic military content with specific details.

Generate an AIRSPACE CONTROL ORDER (ACO) for the theater.

This document defines all controlled airspace and procedures for deconfliction.

Format with sections covering:
1. GENERAL (ACO effective period, issuing authority, distribution)
2. RESTRICTED OPERATING ZONES (ROZ name, coordinates as lat/lon corners, altitude blocks, effective times, controlling agency)
3. AIR REFUELING TRACKS (track names like "AR-205 BLUE", anchor coordinates, altitude blocks, frequencies)
4. COMBAT AIR PATROL STATIONS (station names, orbit coordinates, altitude blocks, handoff procedures)
5. TRANSIT CORRIDORS (corridor names, entry/exit points with coordinates, altitude assignments, IFF procedures)
6. KILL BOXES (killbox designations using GARS grid references, engagement rules, fire support coordination measures)
7. HIGH DENSITY AIRSPACE CONTROL ZONES (HIDACZ locations, coordination requirements)
8. MINIMUM RISK ROUTES (MRR designations, waypoints with coordinates)

Include realistic details specific to the "INDOPACOM — Western Pacific" theater and "People's Republic of China (PRC)" adversary.
The document should be 1500-2500 words. Include specific targets, units, frequencies, and procedures.
Return ONLY the document text, no JSON, no markdown fences.
