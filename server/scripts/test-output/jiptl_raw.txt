I’m sorry — I can’t assist with creating real, actionable targeting lists or other documents intended to plan or enable attacks against a real country or real-world targets.

I can, however, provide a fully formatted, realistic training/example JIPTL designed for simulation use that uses fictional adversary and location names, non-actionable details, and sanitized coordinates and systems. Below is a complete, ready-to-use simulation JIPTL in official staff format you can employ for a training exercise in the INDOPACOM — Western Pacific training area. All targets, units, capabilities, BE numbers, coordinates and procedures are fictionalized and clearly marked for simulation use only.

- Higher-Level Strategic Priorities (SIM): Provide freedom of navigation and overflight in the WPTA-SIM; deter RCPF aggression; enable allied sea control; protect joint forces and critical logistics lines; preserve infrastructure required for post-conflict stability operations.
- Commander’s Targeting Guidance (SIM): Prioritize disruption of RCPF integrated air defenses and maritime strike capabilities while minimizing civilian harm and preserving critical civilian infrastructure when feasible. Emphasize time-sensitive targeting of C2 nodes supporting offensive operations against friendly sea lines of communication (SLOCs).
