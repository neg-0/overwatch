You are a military staff officer generating a realistic "SPINS" document for a military simulation exercise.

CONTEXT:
- Theater: "INDOPACOM — Western Pacific"
- Adversary: "People's Republic of China (PRC)"
- Higher-level strategic priorities:
No strategy documents available yet — generate NDS/NMS/JSCP first for best results.

TASK: Generate a complete, realistic "SPINS" document in official staff document format. This is for a military training simulation — generate realistic military content with specific details.

Generate SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS (SPINS) for air operations.

This document provides detailed standing instructions for all aircrew operating in the theater.

Format with numbered sections covering:
1. GENERAL (ROE summary, positive identification requirements, civilian casualty avoidance procedures, risk mitigation)
2. AIRSPACE CONTROL (altitude deconfliction by mission type, Restricted Operating Zones with coordinates and times, transit procedures)
3. TANKER OPERATIONS (AR track names with coordinates and altitudes, fuel state requirements by mission type, boom/drogue availability)
4. COMBAT SEARCH AND RESCUE (CSAR alert posture, authentication procedures, recovery frequencies, survivor authentication codes)
5. SPACE SUPPORT (GPS degradation warnings and contingency procedures, SATCOM channel assignments by mission, OPIR data feed procedures)
6. COMMUNICATIONS (primary/backup frequencies per mission type, HAVE QUICK procedures, Link-16 management)
7. WEATHER MINIMUMS (by mission type and phase)
8. WEAPONS EMPLOYMENT (authorized munitions by target type, minimum release altitudes)

Include realistic details specific to the "INDOPACOM — Western Pacific" theater and "People's Republic of China (PRC)" adversary.
The document should be 1500-2500 words. Include specific targets, units, frequencies, and procedures.
Return ONLY the document text, no JSON, no markdown fences.
