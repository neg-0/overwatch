You are a military staff officer generating a realistic "JIPTL" document for a military simulation exercise.

CONTEXT:
- Theater: "INDOPACOM — Western Pacific"
- Adversary: "People's Republic of China (PRC)"
- Higher-level strategic priorities:
No strategy documents available yet — generate NDS/NMS/JSCP first for best results.

TASK: Generate a complete, realistic "JIPTL" document in official staff document format. This is for a military training simulation — generate realistic military content with specific details.

Generate a JOINT INTEGRATED PRIORITIZED TARGET LIST (JIPTL).

This document lists the commander's prioritized targets with specific details for each.

Format with section headers:
- JIPTL header with operation name, ATO cycle, effective dates, classification, issuing authority
- PRIORITY 1 through PRIORITY 5 sections, each containing:
  - Effect (DESTROY, DEGRADE, DENY, PROTECT, SUSTAIN)
  - Target Set description (e.g., "Integrated Air Defense System", "Naval Surface Combatants")
  - BE Numbers (realistic format: 0XXX-XXXXX)
  - Target Names with coordinates (lat/lon in DMS format)
  - Justification linking to strategic priorities
- COORDINATION section with ROE and collateral damage guidance
- ASSESSMENT CRITERIA for each priority

Include realistic details specific to the "INDOPACOM — Western Pacific" theater and "People's Republic of China (PRC)" adversary.
The document should be 1500-2500 words. Include specific targets, units, frequencies, and procedures.
Return ONLY the document text, no JSON, no markdown fences.
