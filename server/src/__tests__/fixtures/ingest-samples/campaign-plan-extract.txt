CAMPAIGN PLAN 5077-26 — OPERATION PACIFIC SHIELD
COMMANDER, UNITED STATES INDO-PACIFIC COMMAND
EFFECTIVE: 1 March 2026

1. SITUATION.
   a. Enemy Forces. The PRC has positioned approximately 3 carrier strike groups, 12 submarines, and 200+ combat aircraft within operational reach of the First Island Chain. Advanced integrated air defense systems (IADS) including HQ-9 and S-400 variants are assessed operational on multiple island positions.
   b. Friendly Forces. USINDOPACOM has deployed CSG-5 (USS Ronald Reagan), CSG-11 (USS Nimitz), and supporting forces. USAF 5th Air Force and 7th Air Force provide theater air capabilities. USSPACECOM provides space support through 614 AOC.

2. MISSION. USINDOPACOM conducts multi-domain operations to deter PRC aggression, assure allies, and if necessary, defeat adversary forces to maintain a free and open Indo-Pacific.

3. COMMANDER'S PRIORITIES FOR TARGETING AND EFFECTS.
   a. Priority 1 — SUPPRESS adversary integrated air defense system (IADS) to gain air superiority over the East China Sea operating area. This is the prerequisite for all follow-on operations.
   b. Priority 2 — DEGRADE adversary command and control (C2) infrastructure to disrupt operational decision-making and coordination across PRC forces.
   c. Priority 3 — DENY adversary naval freedom of movement in the Philippine Sea and South China Sea to protect sea lines of communication.
   d. Priority 4 — PROTECT friendly space-based assets from adversary ASAT threats. GPS, SATCOM, and OPIR constellation protection is critical to joint force effectiveness.
   e. Priority 5 — SUSTAIN persistent ISR coverage of the theater to maintain battlespace awareness and decision advantage over adversary forces.

4. CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS.
   a. Phase I (Shape): Increase force presence, enhance alliance readiness, conduct ISR to establish baseline.
   b. Phase II (Deter): Demonstrate combat power through exercises and FONOPs, posture forces for rapid response.
   c. Phase III (Seize Initiative): If deterrence fails, execute OCA to suppress IADS, followed by maritime strike and C2 degradation.
   d. Phase IV (Dominate): Achieve multi-domain superiority, deny adversary sanctuary, protect allied territory.
   e. Phase V (Stabilize): Transition to post-conflict posture, restore freedom of navigation, support diplomatic resolution.
