4. COMMANDER'S INTENT. The Joint Force will maintain a posture that deters conflict while prepared to respond decisively if deterrence fails. All operations will be conducted in accordance with the law of armed conflict and standing rules of engagement.

5. ENDSTATE. A stable Western Pacific where freedom of navigation is assured, allied sovereignty is respected, and adversary coercion is effectively countered.
