# Master Air Attack Plan (MAAP)

MASTER AIR ATTACK PLAN (MAAP)
Operation: INDOPACOM SHIELD — Multi-Domain Joint Integration and Resilience (MDJIR) (EXERCISE / NOTIONAL)
Theater: Western Pacific (INDOPACOM) — Exercise-Only, Non-Executable
MAAP Coverage: Day 1 through Day 15 (01–15 MAR 2026), with daily ATO development driven by this MAAP and updated by AOD/PRF/ISR assessment each ATO cycle.
Supported Commander: JFC (Exercise)
Supporting Commander: JFACC (Exercise AOC)

NOTE ON SANITIZATION: This MAAP is intentionally generalized and non-executable. It uses notional operating locations (POB/FOS/Carrier), notional track/station names, and deliberately avoids real-world installation targeting, coordinates, frequencies, or unit-specific tactics. Sortie numbers are for staff training and simulation only.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. COMMANDER’S GUIDANCE
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1.1 Operational Emphasis (Exercise Effects)
a. Priority of effort is to demonstrate joint force resilience and decision advantage under contested C2: intermittent SATCOM, degraded PNT, datalink interference, and cyber pressure on logistics and unclassified networks.
b. Air operations will focus on generating repeatable effects aligned to the exercise JIPTL priorities:
   (1) P1: Rapidly neutralize adversary A2/AD strike and IADS “gates” to open/hold maneuver corridors.
   (2) P2: Degrade adversary theater ISR/C2 to reduce their targeting cycle and force dithering.
   (3) P3: Suppress/attrit adversary air and maritime strike capacity (airfields, maritime surface action groups as simulated).
   (4) P4: Disrupt adversary operational sustainment and deployment tempo (logistics nodes, fuel/munitions distribution as simulated).
   (5) P5: Protect the force and preserve coalition access: DCA, maritime protection, CSAR posture, and information operations synchronization (exercise injects).

1.2 Desired End State (Exercise)
a. JFACC maintains continuous, resilient C2 to generate ATOs despite comm degradation.
b. Air component establishes and sustains:
   (1) Two notional air maneuver corridors through the First Island Chain equivalent (exercise geometry),
   (2) A persistent DCA umbrella over designated defended assets (DAs),
   (3) A repeatable kill-chain for time-sensitive targets (TSTs) under degraded PNT/SATCOM, demonstrated in Phase 3.

1.3 Targeting and Fires Restrictions (Exercise / Training)
a. No real-world lethal execution is authorized; all effects are simulated/adjudicated.
b. No strikes against real-world civilian infrastructure; “dual-use” targets are represented only as simulated target sets with EXCON-approved aimpoints.
c. Collateral damage constraints are modeled: planners must select aimpoints and fuzing concepts that would keep collateral effects within “LOW” modeled thresholds unless EXCON directs otherwise.
d. No-cyber impact boundaries: cyber effects will be simulated and restricted to exercise networks/constructs; no real-world systems.

1.4 Risk Tolerance
a. Operational risk to mission accomplishment: MODERATE. Accept localized sortie shortfalls if required to preserve C2 integrity, force protection, and safety-of-flight in degraded nav.
b. Risk to force (exercise attrition model): LOW to MODERATE. Do not trade away 5th-gen penetration capacity early; prioritize survivability and electronic protection.
c. Logistics risk: MODERATE. Expect contested fuel and weapons movement; plan for “lean” forward stocks and prioritize high-payoff effects over volume.

1.5 C2 and Communications Intent (Degraded Environment)
a. Primary: mission-type orders and commander’s intent; minimize real-time micromanagement.
b. Data-link denial is expected; packages must be able to execute with:
   (1) pre-briefed ROZ/route decision points,
   (2) inertial nav and timing back-ups,
   (3) comm-out rejoin and divert procedures.
c. Airborne C2 will be treated as a contested asset; maintain emission control (EMCON) discipline per daily SPINS and EXCON adjudication.

2.4 Daily Totals vs. Capacity (Baseline)
Phase 1 (Days 1–3) baseline fighter sorties:
- P1 34 + P2 14 + P3 20 + P4 8 + P5 31 = 107 fighter sorties/day
Planned fighter capacity: 28 + 23 + 49 = 100 fighter sorties/day
Delta: -7 (shortfall) mitigations:
- Reduce P5 by 5 (accept moderate risk; rely on layered ship-based IAMD injects)
- Reduce P3 by 2 (delay non-critical neutralization targets to Day 2/3)
Adjusted Phase 1 planned: 100 fighter sorties/day + 3 ISR/day + 18–22 enablers/day

Phase 2 (Days 4–7) baseline fighter sorties:
- P1 22 + P2 18 + P3 26 + P4 14 + P5 24 = 104 fighter sorties/day
Capacity: 100 fighter sorties/day
Delta: -4 mitigations:
- Reduce P3 by 2 (retain ability to surge)
- Reduce P5 by 2 (accept moderate risk; increase alert posture at DAs)
Adjusted Phase 2 planned: 100 fighter sorties/day + 3 ISR/day + 16–20 enablers/day

Phase 3 (Days 8+) baseline fighter sorties:
- P1 14 + P2 16 + P3 22 + P4 20 + P5 20 = 92 fighter sorties/day
Capacity: 100 fighter sorties/day
Surplus: +8 held as flex for dynamic targeting, weather re-attacks, or maintenance recovery; allocate by AOD to TST windows.

2.5 Notional Weapon/Loadout Policy (Exercise-Only)
a. Emphasize “effects-based” loads: fewer aimpoints per sortie when PNT is degraded and comm re-attacks are uncertain.
b. Preserve limited high-end munitions inventory (simulated) for P1/P2 and Phase 3 TST; push P4 with medium confidence aimpoints only when ISR cueing is strong.
c. When GPS quality is assessed “DEGRADED,” shift to:
   (1) preplanned visual/INS-aided deliveries (simulated),
   (2) standoff effects (simulated),
   (3) non-kinetic suppression where available (exercise).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
3. PHASE EMPLOYMENT CONCEPT
----------------------------------------------------------------------

3.1 Phase 1 (Days 1–3): Initial Strikes, SEAD, DCA Establishment
Purpose: Create operational access (simulated), blunt adversary first salvo potential, and establish a stable DCA/HVAA protection architecture while demonstrating C2 resilience.

Key tasks by day:
Day 1:
- P1: Execute “Gate Opener” packages against the two highest-payoff A2/AD strike complexes and IADS sector operations nodes (simulated target sets). Objective is to reduce modeled threat rings and open Corridor A.
- P5: Establish two continuous BARCAPs over primary defended assets; prioritize HVAA escort for tankers and airborne C2.
- P2: ISR-led mapping of emitter activity; initiate degradation of theater ISR/C2 via simulated node strikes and non-kinetic actions.
Day 2:
- P1: Expand SEAD/DEAD to adjacent IADS nodes to hold Corridor A and open Corridor B (second maneuver corridor).
- P3: Begin OCA sweeps and simulated airfield suppression to reduce adversary sortie generation and maritime strike cueing.
- P2: Continue suppression of data relay and targeting network; focus on shortening adversary kill-chain.
Day 3:
- Consolidate: Re-attack surviving/relocated P1 elements as cued by ISR; transition from “breach” to “hold” operations.
- Increase P3/P4 only if P1 effects are assessed sufficient (MOE threshold in Section 6).

Rules of employment (Phase 1):
- Do not expend more than 60% of simulated “high-end” stocks before Day 4 unless EXCON inject indicates imminent major adversary strike.
- Maintain at least one DCA orbit at all times; no “all-in” strike day.

3.2 Phase 2 (Days 4–7): Sustained Operations, Deep Strike
Purpose: Sustain pressure on adversary operational system while maintaining access and protecting the force; shift weight from “opening” to sustained degradation and interdiction.

Operational approach:
- P1: Maintain “Suppression Belt” along Corridors A/B; prioritize mobile long-range strike systems and reconstituting IADS nodes (simulated).
- P2: Intensify attacks on command and sensor fusion nodes (simulated), using ISR to identify redundancy and force “fallback to voice” conditions in adversary construct.
- P3: Expand maritime strike and counter-air to attrit adversary strike packages before they can mass; use carrier-based aviation for flexible presence.
- P4: Begin deliberate interdiction of key sustainment lines; aim to create cascading delays (modeled) in fuel and weapons distribution.
- P5: Reduce routine CAP density slightly, but maintain surge-ready alert and HVAA escort.

Daily rhythm (Phase 2):
- Two major strike windows/day (one day, one night cycle), with one smaller dynamic window for TST/SCAR.
- ISR aircraft fly a “long look” every day to maintain continuity of electronic order of battle and cue dynamic re-attacks.

3.3 Phase 3 (Days 8+): Exploitation, Dynamic Targeting
Purpose: Demonstrate ability to exploit advantage, prosecute dynamic targets, and preserve force while sustaining contested C2.

Operational approach:
- Shift from fixed target emphasis to dynamic targeting, armed ISR, and SCAR to prosecute time-sensitive targets (mobile launchers, maritime movers, pop-up IADS nodes—simulated).
- Use sortie surplus (Section 2.4) as a “flex pool” for weather re-attacks, divert-tasked interdiction, and surge DCA in response to adversary raid injects.
- Emphasize low signature and comm discipline. When SATCOM is denied, execute with preplanned decision points and on-scene commander intent.

Phase 3 success condition:
- Demonstrated completion of at least one full “degraded kill-chain” per day: detect → identify → task → engage → assess under simulated comm/PNT degradation.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
4. SPACE SUPPORT REQUIREMENTS (EXERCISE)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

4.1 PNT (GPS / Multi-Constellation) Support Concept
a. Planning assumption: intermittent jamming/spoofing creates two daily “PNT stress windows” and localized outages near high-value target sets (simulated).
b. Precision engagement windows (planning guidance):
- Primary “High-Confidence PNT” windows: 0300Z–0700Z and 1500Z–1900Z (exercise-controlled). Schedule the most PNT-sensitive P1/P2 strikes inside these windows when feasible.
- “Degraded PNT” windows: 0700Z–1100Z and 1900Z–2300Z. Use for DCA, maritime presence, and less PNT-sensitive interdiction where INS/visual backup is acceptable (simulated).
c. Mitigations:
- Require preplanned aimpoint mensuration and inertial navigation cross-check.
- Include timing gates based on TOT windows rather than continuous updates.
- Maintain a minimum of two independent timing sources for package lead (exercise procedure).

4.2 SATCOM Allocation by Mission Type (Notional)
a. Protected SATCOM (EHF class) priorities:
(1) Airborne C2 nodes and AOC reachback continuity
(2) HVAA coordination for tankers and ISR aircraft
(3) Package-level retasking for P1/P2 when datalinks are degraded
b. Tactical SATCOM (UHF/MUOS class) priorities:
(1) Fighter package coordination when LOS is blocked
(2) CSAR alert coordination and survivor communications (exercise)
(3) Maritime coordination for dynamic targeting
c. Wideband SATCOM priorities:
(1) ISR product dissemination to the AOC (when available)
(2) ATO/ACO/SPINS distribution to forward nodes
d. Contested SATCOM mitigation:
- Assume one wideband path degraded at any time; plan alternate routing via protected SATCOM for critical C2 messages and use store-and-forward for non-critical products.
- Daily SPINS will designate “comms minimums” and authentication procedures for comm restoration.

4.3 ISR / OPIR Support Schedule (Exercise)
a. OPIR (launch detect) support is assumed continuous but with reporting delays during contested comm windows.
b. Daily ISR deck (baseline):
- 1 SIGINT/ISR sortie during the primary strike window (0300Z–0700Z) focused on P1/P2 cueing and emitter mapping.
- 1 SIGINT/ISR sortie during the secondary window (1500Z–1900Z) focused on maritime/air track correlation and post-strike assessment.
- 1 SIGINT/ISR sortie “swing” scheduled by AOD for highest-need: either dynamic targeting in Phase 3 or re-attack cueing in Phase 2.
c. Collection priorities:
(1) Emitter geolocation and identification to support SEAD/DEAD adjudication
(2) Maritime mover detection and classification (simulated)
(3) Post-strike indications for BDA modeling (communications shifts, emitter silence, rerouting)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
5. FLOW PLAN
----------------------------------------------------------------------

5.1 Airspace and Routing Construct (Notional)
a. Two primary maneuver corridors (Corridor A and Corridor B) defined in the ACO with time-phased activation; corridors are opened by Phase 1 P1 effects and held by continuous suppression.
b. Package assembly areas:
- ASSEMBLY WEST (for carrier-based packages)
- ASSEMBLY EAST (for land-based packages)
c. ROZs (restricted operating zones) will be published daily; dynamic ROZ establishment is authorized via airborne C2 if comm allows.

5.2 Tanker Flow and Tracks (Notional, No Coordinates)
a. Tanker tracks (all notional; geometry published in ACO as track boxes):
- TRACK ALPHA (forward, high-demand): supports penetration/escort and time-on-station for CAPs
- TRACK BRAVO (mid): supports strike packages prior to corridor entry
- TRACK CHARLIE (rear): recovery/emergency/divert support
b. Tanker sortie allocation by 6-hour period (Phase 1 peak / Phase 2 steady / Phase 3 flexible):
Time Block 0000Z–0600Z:
- Phase 1: 4 tanker sorties (2 ALPHA, 1 BRAVO, 1 CHARLIE)
- Phase 2: 3 tanker sorties (1 ALPHA, 1 BRAVO, 1 CHARLIE)
- Phase 3: 2–3 tanker sorties (0–1 ALPHA depending on TST; 1 BRAVO; 1 CHARLIE)
Time Block 0600Z–1200Z:
- Phase 1: 3 tanker sorties (1 ALPHA, 1 BRAVO, 1 CHARLIE)
- Phase 2: 3 tanker sorties (1 ALPHA, 1 BRAVO, 1 CHARLIE)
- Phase 3: 2 tanker sorties (1 BRAVO, 1 CHARLIE)
Time Block 1200Z–1800Z:
- Phase 1: 4 tanker sorties (2 ALPHA, 1 BRAVO, 1 CHARLIE)
- Phase 2: 4 tanker sorties (1–2 ALPHA, 1 BRAVO, 1 CHARLIE)
- Phase 3: 3 tanker sorties (1 ALPHA for dynamic window, 1 BRAVO, 1 CHARLIE)
Time Block 1800Z–2400Z:
- Phase 1: 3 tanker sorties (1 ALPHA, 1 BRAVO, 1 CHARLIE)
- Phase 2: 3 tanker sorties (1 ALPHA, 1 BRAVO, 1 CHARLIE)
- Phase 3: 2 tanker sorties (1 BRAVO, 1 CHARLIE)
c. Tanker demand management:
- Strike packages receive refuel priority during corridor transit windows.
- DCA CAPs are planned with one scheduled top-off per 2.5–3.0 hours.
- In “tanker short” conditions, reduce P4 first, then P3, while preserving P1/P2 and minimum DCA.

5.3 Sortie Flow per 6-Hour Period (Representative Daily Flow)
The following depicts a representative Phase 2 day (Days 4–7). Phase 1 shifts more weight to 0000Z–0600Z and 1200Z–1800Z for opening/holding; Phase 3 increases “flex” in 1200Z–2400Z for dynamic targeting.

0000Z–0600Z (Primary Strike Window / High-Confidence PNT):
- P1 “Hold/Breach” packages: 10–12 fighter sorties
- P2 node degradation packages: 6–8 fighter sorties + 1 ISR
- P5 HVAA escort + BARCAP: 10–12 fighter sorties
- Enablers: 1 AWACS + 3–4 tankers

0600Z–1200Z (Transition / Degraded PNT):
- P3 sweep / maritime presence: 10–12 fighter sorties
- P5 BARCAP sustainment: 8–10 fighter sorties
- P4 limited interdiction (only if ISR-cued): 4–6 fighter sorties
- Enablers: 1 AWACS + 3 tankers

1200Z–1800Z (Secondary Strike Window / High-Confidence PNT):
- P3 maritime strike / OCA: 10–14 fighter sorties
- P4 deliberate interdiction: 6–8 fighter sorties
- P2 follow-up / re-attack: 6–8 fighter sorties + 1 ISR
- Enablers: 1 AWACS + 4 tankers

1800Z–2400Z (Dynamic Window / Recovery):
- P1 re-attack (as cued): 4–6 fighter sorties (Phase 2) / 2–4 (Phase 3)
- P4 armed recce / SCAR: 6–8 fighter sorties (Phase 3 emphasis)
- P5 night BARCAP and alert launches: 6–8 fighter sorties
- Enablers: 1 AWACS + 2–3 tankers + CSAR alert posture

5.4 AWACS Coverage Rotation (Notional)
Objective: sustain two overlapping orbits in Phase 1–2, then one continuous plus one surge orbit in Phase 3.

a. Orbit structure:
- ORBIT SKYLOOK-1 (forward battle management, corridor control, CAP management)
- ORBIT SKYLOOK-2 (rear/mid, recovery control, tanker management, comm relay)
b. AWACS sorties/day:
- Phase 1: 4 sorties/day (2 per orbit, ~6 hours on-station each with overlap)
- Phase 2: 4 sorties/day (same, with increased comm relay function)
- Phase 3: 3–4 sorties/day (one continuous orbit; second orbit surged during TST windows or adversary raid injects)
c. Emissions and survivability:
- Use minimum required emissions; rely on mission-type orders and procedural control if datalinks are degraded.
- If threat to HVAA increases (exercise inject), pull SKYLOOK-1 aft and increase fighter escort rather than cancel the orbit.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
6. ASSESSMENT CRITERIA (MEASURES OF EFFECTIVENESS)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Assessment will be conducted daily by the AOC Strategy Division and ISR/Targeting Effects Team using exercise adjudication, simulated BDA, comm logs, and mission reports. MOEs below drive next-day MAAP adjustments and ATO apportionment.

MOE-P4.3: Re-attack efficiency: ≥60% of re-attacks allocated only after ISR confirmation of continued target value (avoid “wasted” sorties in contested ISR).

P5 (Defend / preserve force and access)
MOE-P5.1: Defended asset integrity: maintain ≥95% DA availability (modeled), with rapid recovery from attack injects.
MOE-P5.2: HVAA survival and mission continuity: tankers/AWACS/ISR complete ≥90% of planned on-station time.
MOE-P5.3: CSAR posture effectiveness (exercise): alert response timelines met ≥90% (scramble-to-airborne, ingress readiness, comm plan execution).
MOE-P5.4: Sortie generation resilience: maintain fighter MC rate and SGR within 10% of plan despite contested logistics/cyber injects.

MAAP EXECUTION NOTES (FOR DAILY ATO DEVELOPMENT)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

A. Apportionment “Floor” (do not drop below without JFACC approval):
- P1 + P2 combined: minimum 30 fighter sorties/day during Phases 1–2; minimum 24/day during Phase 3.
- P5 DCA/HVAA: minimum 18 fighter sorties/day all phases (CAP + escort combined), surge-capable on 2-hour notice.

B. Apportionment “Flex” (first to trade when constrained):
- P4 is the primary give-back during tanker shortages or PNT degradation.
- P3 is second give-back unless adversary raid injects indicate increased maritime/air threat.

C. Daily Timing Anchors (planning anchors; adjust per weather/EXCON):
