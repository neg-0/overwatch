6. KILL BOXES
Kill boxes designate three-dimensional areas where joint fires may be executed with deconfliction measures to expedite engagements. All engagements are simulated under exercise rules unless otherwise annotated as live fire in range control annexes.

General Kill Box Procedures:
- Engagement authority within each kill box is delegated to the Joint Fires Element (JFE-EX) under JFACC-EX with prescribed weapons release procedures.
- Aircrews must receive positive clearance from JFE-EX and authentication code for each engagement. Unplanned engagement against emergent threats requires contact with CAOW-EX; if comms denied, default to self-defense ROE.
- Effects: The following kill boxes are authorized for air-to-surface, surface-to-surface, and anti-surface seaborne fires as designated. All munitions employment within the kill box must abide by simulated collateral constraints in Annex D and be corroborated by joint DCA/EWR assets.

6.1. KILL BOX K-RED-1 (OFFENSIVE AIR-TO-SURFACE)
- Designation: K-RED-1
- Coordinates (box corners): NW 21°30.0’N 125°30.0’E; NE 21°30.0’N 126°30.0’E; SE 20°30.0’N 126°30.0’E; SW 20°30.0’N 125°30.0’E
- Altitudinal limits: Surface — FL460
- Permitted Effects: Air-to-surface strikes (SIM), UAS attack sorties (SIM), cruise missile simulated launches (SIM).
- Engagement Rules: Positive two-source targeting (ISR asset + JTAC-EX or JFE-EX) required for high-value target simulation. Weapons release authority: JFACC-EX delegated to On-Scene Commander only when JTAC-EX confirms target and Centre of Gravity (COG) assessment completed. SEAD/DEAD allowed but must coordinate with EW cell and not exceed simulated frequency occupancy.

6.2. KILL BOX K-BLUE-2 (ANTI-SURFACE)
- Designation: K-BLUE-2
- Coordinates (box corners): NW 18°50.0’N 130°10.0’E; NE 18°50.0’N 131°00.0’E; SE 17°50.0’N 131°00.0’E; SW 17°50.0’N 130°10.0’E
- Altitudinal limits: Surface — FL220
- Permitted Effects: Anti-surface warfare simulated engagements (air-launched and surface-launched), maritime strike coordination.
- Engagement Rules: Require clearance from Maritime Fires Element (MFE-EX) and positive identification of target vessel by two separate sensors (radar + visual/EO/IR). No simulated missiles to be expended within 10 NM of ELN-EX unless under specific live-fire authorization by ASRC-EX.

6.3. KILL BOX K-GREEN-3 (SUPPRESSION OF IADS / SEAD)
- Designation: K-GREEN-3
- Coordinates: Center 20°10.0’N 124°00.0’E with 30 NM radius
- Altitudinal limits: Surface — FL460
- Permitted Effects: SEAD/DEAD suppression operations, EW sorties, jamming trial lanes.
- Engagement Rules: All SEAD/DEAD must coordinate with EW Control Authority (EWCA-EX). Jamming windows will be distributed in 30-minute blocks; CAOW-EX will publish jam codes. Friendly airframes will configure ECCM as defined in the ATO.

6.4. KILL BOX K-YELLOW-4 (JOINT-FORCES INTEGRATED STRIKE)
- Designation: K-YELLOW-4 (Dynamic)
- Coordinates: Variable; activated/deactivated by JFACC-EX with 30-minute notice to CAOW-EX and ADC-EX.
- Altitudinal limits: As promulgated in activation message.
- Permitted Effects: Multi-domain integrated strike with coordinated maritime, air, cyber, and space-simulated effects.
- Engagement Rules: Requires pre-coordination in the Mission Planning Cell (MPC-EX), positive fire support coordination measures, and deconfliction brief 60 minutes prior to activation. Cyber-kinetic sequencing must confirm simulated space SATCOM windows to avoid inadvertent fratricide of friendly comms.

7. SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND SAFETY
7.1. DCA and Friendly Air Defense. Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ-EX) procedures will be strictly enforced around POB-EX and FOS-EX. All participants must maintain updated Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) EX codes. Any aircraft failing to comply will be treated as OPFOR-EX after exercise-prescribed warnings.

7.2. Electronic Warfare and EMCON. EMCON profiles will be set in ATO. EW operations within ROZ-DELTA and K-GREEN-3 require CAOW-EX coordination and publication of permitted emitter windows. Passive navigation and LPI comms strongly encouraged. GPS-denial simulation will be active in ROZ-DELTA and selected corridors; alternate navigation (inertial, TACAN) must be pre-briefed.

7.3. Space/Stratospheric Asset Deconfliction. Simulated satellite outages will be managed by CAOW-EX. High-altitude ISR or stratospheric platforms must coordinate to avoid conflicts with civilian transits. Any would-be real-world overflight of international civil airspace remains outside exercise control and will be coordinated through civil authorities.

7.4. Ordnance and Munitions. All weapons employment during the exercise will be simulated unless otherwise directed by ASRC-EX via a Live Fire Authorization Note. Live munitions use must be scheduled through ASRC-EX and range control and will adhere to host-nation and international safety standards.

7.5. Air-to-Air Refueling (AAR) Emergencies. Emergency AAR procedures (low fuel state declarations) shall follow the Ladder-of-Preferences in Annex E. Primary emergency recovery fields: nearest POB-EX or designated ALT-EX bases. CAOW-EX to issue emergency reallocation with highest priority.

8. REPORTING, AMENDMENTS, AND COORDINATION
8.1. ACO Amendments. CAOW-EX will publish ACO amendments (01-EX A, B, C…) to reflect dynamic ROZ activation, kill box changes, and AR track updates. Amendments become effective upon broadcast and acknowledgment by primary units.

8.2. Incident and Safety Reporting. All incidents (near misses, losses, unexpected weapons simulation impacts, or simulated fratricide) must be reported immediately to CAOW-EX and ADC-EX and documented in the Exercise Safety Report (ESR) within 12 hours.

8.3. RFI and Deconfliction. Units requiring corridor/ROZ exemptions must submit RFI to ADC-EX no less than 48 hours prior to operation. Time-critical requests accepted under commander’s discretion but require CAOW-EX concurrence.
