# JIPTL

I cannot provide real-world targeting details, precise coordinates for actual facilities, unit-specific targeting procedures, or operational frequencies because that could meaningfully facilitate military wrongdoing. I can, however, provide a fully sanitized, fictionalized, and non-executable Joint Integrated Prioritized Target List (JIPTL) template tailored for exercise and training purposes that aligns with the provided strategic guidance and theater context. The following is a training/exercise JIPTL for the NOTIONAL exercise INDOPACOM SHIELD — MDJIR. All targets, locations, unit names, coordinates, and identifiers are fictional and for training/simulation only.

JOINT INTEGRATED PRIORITIZED TARGET LIST (JIPTL)
Operation: INDOPACOM SHIELD — Multi-Domain Joint Integration and Resilience (MDJIR) (Exercise)
ATO Cycle: Cycle 03 (Exercise ATO/ACO Development)
Effective Dates: 010000Z MAR 2026 — 152359Z MAR 2026
Classification: UNCLASSIFIED // FOUO (Exercise)
Issuing Authority: USINDOPACOM J3/J5 Targeting Cell (Exercise TOC)

PURPOSE: This JIPTL provides prioritized target nominations for exercise MDJIR in support of theater strategic priorities: integrated deterrence, campaign resilience, contested logistics mitigation, and preservation of allied access in the Western Pacific. This document traces target priorities to National Defense Strategy extract and CJCS NMS Theater Annex effects and supports joint targeting, ATO/ACO development, and assessment in a degraded SATCOM / contested C2 environment. All entries are exercise-only, non-actionable, and use fictionalized data.

PRIORITY 1 — EFFECT: DESTROY
Strategic Rationale: Rapidly deny the adversary’s critical anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) and short-warning strike capabilities that could enable a rapid fait accompli within the First Island Chain; protect U.S. and allied forces’ freedom of maneuver and sustainment lines per NDS integrated deterrence and NMS LOE-1 and LOE-2.

Target Set: Adversary Theater Ballistic/Anti-Ship Cruise Missile (ASCM) Launch and C4 Nodes
- BE Number: 0001-0001
  - Target Name: NOTIONAL State A — Coastal Anti-Ship Missile Battery “Kappa”
    - Coordinates: LAT 12°34'00" N / LON 136°12'00" E (Fictional)
    - Justification: Kappa battery houses mobile ASCM cells and targeting radars that directly threaten Allied maritime transit lanes and amphibious lines of communications. Neutralizing Kappa reduces adversary A2/AD reach and supports joint maritime freedom of movement (NDS: integrated deterrence; NMS: deny operational fait accompli).
    - COORDINATION: Require PACFLT and MARFORPAC strike deconfliction; coordinate maritime airspace control with PACAF AOC; acquire battlespace coordination line (BCL) and maritime surface picture from Combined Maritime Coordination Center (exercise). Targeting execution requires positive ID (PID) via ISR assets before engagement.

- BE Number: 0001-0002
  - Target Name: NOTIONAL State A — Theater Ballistic Missile (TBM) Launch Complex “Lambda”
    - Coordinates: LAT 13°01'30" N / LON 137°05'45" E (Fictional)
    - Justification: Lambda supports short-range ballistic missile (SRBM) salvo launches against forward US/Allied bases. Destroying Lambda reduces immediate threat to Primary Operating Bases (POBs) and expeditionary nodes, enabling sustainment under contested logistics conditions.
    - COORDINATION: Coordinate with USSTRATCOM exercise liaison for joint missile warning; synchronize pre-planned mitigation fires with theater missile defense (TMD) assets and civil infrastructure protection cells.

- BE Number: 0001-0003
  - Target Name: NOTIONAL State A — Regional C4 Node “Orion”
    - Coordinates: LAT 12°45'15" N / LON 135°58'50" E (Fictional)
    - Justification: Orion aggregates sensor feeds and issues fire-control tracks for A2/AD systems. Destroying Orion degrades adversary kill-chain integration and extends US/Allied operations time windows.
    - COORDINATION: Coordinate cyber/electronic attack (EA) integration with J6/J39; synchronise with space-resilient timing alternatives; ensure combined-force assessment of collateral effects.

PRIORITY 2 — EFFECT: DEGRADE
Strategic Rationale: Disrupt adversary ISR, targeting, and sustainment nodes to prevent effective coordination and delay operational effects, enabling stabilization of key theater lines of effort and ensuring distributed force survivability.

    - COORDINATION: J4 and Combined Logistics Over-The-Shore (CLOTS) exercise planners to coordinate priorities; civil-engineering liaison embedded for damage assessment and prioritized repair timelines.

TARGETING PRIORITIZATION NOTES / LINKAGE TO STRATEGY
- Priority 1 targets directly enable the creation of operational space for joint force maneuver and protect allied access—key to integrated deterrence and preventing rapid adversary fait accompli (NDS, NMS LOE-1/LOE-2).
- Priority 2 targets focus on degrading sensor-to-shooter linkages, reducing adversary situational awareness to enable distributed operations under contested information environments (NMS emphasis on contested C2 and intermittent SATCOM).
- Priority 3 tasks deny adversary sustainment and littoral staging, aligning with commercial logistics disruption mitigation and campaign sequencing.
- Priority 4 ensures protection of critical friendly nodes and sustainment hubs to maintain endurance under contested logistics (matching JP 4-0 guidance and NDS persistence).
- Priority 5 maintains sustainment posture and resilience for prolonged campaigning; supports lessons-learned generation and capability gap identification for JCIDS reporting.

TARGETING CONSTRAINTS, COLLATERAL CONSIDERATIONS, & PROCEDURES (EXERCISE)
- All kinetic nominations require Positive Identification (PID) from combined ISR before release in exercise.
- Non-kinetic options (cyber, EW, space-resilient measures) will be prioritized where feasible to minimize simulated collateral damage and to emulate contested C2 conditions while preserving exercise legal and host-nation constraints.
- Collateral Estimation: Exercise legal cell to produce collateral estimates for each BE prior to engagement planning; alternate objectives to be considered if estimated collateral exceeds allowable thresholds per exercise ROE.
- Environmental: For maritime and littoral targets, assess simulated hydrographic and civilian maritime traffic impacts; MCM and harbor-denial mitigation to be coordinated with Combined Maritime Coordination Center (exercise).
- Deconfliction: All strikes and non-kinetic effects must be cleared through AOC/JFACC (exercise), Combined Airspace Control Authority (CACA) and maritime deconfliction cell; implement temporal and geographical separation to prevent fratricide across multi-domain fires.
- Assessment: Pre-planned Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) collection packages to be assigned; cyber and EW effects require observable linkage metrics for attribution in post-strike assessment.
- Dynamic Re-prioritization: In contested, degraded communications scenarios, exercise COCOM delegated authority matrix allows limited, pre-coordinated decentralization of strike approval to designated commanders within constraints (exercise delegated authority checklist to be used).
