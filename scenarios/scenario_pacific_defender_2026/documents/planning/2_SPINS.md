SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS (SPINS)
OPERATION: INDOPACOM SHIELD — WESTERN PACIFIC MDJIR
PERIOD: 010000Z MAR 2026 — 152359Z MAR 2026
REFERENCES: NDS Extract 01 MAR 2026; NMS Theater Annex 01 MAR 2026; JSCP MDJIR 01 MAR 2026; CONPLAN/OPLAN MDJIR 01 MAR 2026; JP 5-0, JP 3-0, JP 3-30, JP 3-52, JP 4-0, JP 6-0, JP 3-12

SYNOPSIS: These Special Instructions (SPINS) provide theater-level, exercise-authorized direction for joint/combined forces participating in MDJIR. SPINS are derived from the NDS/NMS/JSCP/CONPLAN/OPLAN authorities and emphasize integrated deterrence, multi-domain resilience, contested logistics readiness, and operations under intermittent space support and degraded communications. This document is for exercise planning and staff training only. Operational details that would be sensitive in real-world employment are sanitized or presented as placeholders to prevent misuse.

1. GENERAL
1.1 Mission and Strategic Alignment. All actions under MDJIR will support theater strategic lines of effort (LOEs): (A) integrated deterrence and combined posture; (B) resilient multi-domain operations under contested logistics and intermittent SATCOM; (C) preservation of freedom of navigation and access across the First Island Chain. Commanders will apply proportionality and discriminate targeting consistent with national policy and ROE provided in the OPLAN annexes.

1.2 Rules of Engagement (ROE) and Positive Identification (PID).
- Use the ROE baseline in Annex ROE-EX (Exercise ROE) for MDJIR. ROE-EX supplements national ROE with exercise-specific escalation control measures.
- PID standard for lethal fires is Positive Identification of hostile intent or hostile act, and PID must meet the “two-source” confirmation rule where available (e.g., cross-cue from ISR and maritime radar, or ISR and tactical EM signature). When two independent sources are not available due to degraded space/comm conditions, commanders will escalate to the next higher authority per escalation procedures in Annex ROE-EX.
- Engagement authority delegation: Unit commanders will not expand engagement authorities beyond those promulgated in the daily Fragmentary Order (FRAGO). Any deviation requires immediate report to the Combined/Joint Air and Maritime Component Commanders (JFACC/JFMCC) and higher.
- Collateral risk assessment: All strike/tactical fires must include man-made structure and civilian casualty risk estimation using the Joint Collateral Damage Estimation (CDE) process; if duration or SIGINT/IMINT gaps preclude accurate CDE, postpone kinetic action or shift to non-kinetic options.

1.3 Civilian Casualty Avoidance and Protection of Civilian Infrastructure.
- Avoid targets located within 2000 meters of critical civilian infrastructure (hospitals, water treatment facilities, civil power grid nodes) unless an imminent threat to forces is verified and no feasible alternative exists.
- Use non-kinetic, low-collateral means where feasible (e.g., electronic attack, cyber effects, precision non-destructive interdiction).
- Immediate reporting: Any incident involving probable civilian casualties requires transmission of a Civilian Harm Mitigation (CHM) Report to the Joint Staff Exercise Inspector and Combined Civilian-Military Liaison (CML) within 60 minutes.

1.4 Sensitive-Site and Noncombatant Evacuation (NEO) Considerations.
- All forces will respect declared Safety/No-Fly and Evacuation Zones around designated diplomatic/consular facilities and UN-recognized humanitarian corridors. Zone definitions and coordinates are promulgated daily in the Exercise Control (EXCON) product EX-DRAG.
- Theater SOF and Host Nation Partner liaison teams coordinate NEO activities under combined guidelines in Annex NEO-EX.

1.5 Degraded/Denied Logistics and Sustainment.
- Force sustainment operates under the Contested Logistics Concept (CLC-EX). Units will pre-register alternate resupply nodes (ELN placeholders) and plan for 48–72 hour autonomous operations without SATCOM or secure strategic reachback.
- Redistribution authorities: Component commanders may authorize local cross-leveling of expendables up to theater-established thresholds; any redistribution exceeding threshold requires J4 concurrence.

2. AIRSPACE CONTROL
2.1 Airspace Control Authority (ACA) and Commander, Air Component Responsibilities.
- The Joint/Combined Airspace Control Authority (ACA) for MDJIR is exercised by the Combined Air Operations Center (CAOC) in its role as the Air Component Coordination Authority; CAOC will publish the daily Airspace Control Order (ACO-EX) and Air Tasking Order (ATO-EX) execution messages.
- All air operations require enroute coordination with the theater Airborne Surveillance and Airborne Warning (ASAW) cell and Deconfliction Cell (DECON), especially when SATCOM/GPS are degraded.

2.2 Altitude Deconfliction and Flight Levels.
- Standard altitude blocks for fixed- and rotary-wing separation are: Low (surface–5,000 ft), Medium (5,001–20,000 ft), High (20,001–FL350), and Very High (above FL350). These blocks are baseline deconfliction; operational FL assignments are in the daily ACO-EX.
- Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) operating in shared corridors will file altitude blocks in increments of no less than 1,000 ft and adhere to assigned lateral corridors in ACO-EX.

2.3 Restricted Operating Zones (ROZ), No-Fly Areas (NFA), and Maritime Airspace Warnings.
- ROZs and NFAs will be promulgated in ACO-EX with exercise-unique identifiers and placeholder coordinates labeled GRID-ROZ-XX. For exercise use, EXCON will map GRID-ROZ-XX to available simulated locations. ROZ status levels: RED (no operations), AMBER (only with ACA coordination), GREEN (normal operations).
- Example exercise ROZ: GRID-ROZ-01 — AMBER; centered at exercise placeholder LZ-A with a 25 nm radius extending surface to FL180. Real-world coordinates are withheld; commanders will reference EXCON mapping for assigned POB/FOS anchors.
- All aircrew must monitor the CAOC common traffic advisory channel and report ingress/egress through ROZ boundaries using standard formatted callsigns and KOCOA (position, altitude, intent, CSAR status).

2.4 Airspace Deconfliction Procedures.
- All air-to-air refueling, ISR, strike, and tanker tracks must file a deconfliction plan to DECON no later than 60 minutes prior to ETD when SATCOM is available; when SATCOM is degraded, file via resilient HF/LOS relay methods per Section 6.
- Immediate deconfliction: If two platforms are observed on converging tracks without prior coordination, both must execute a pre-approved “aired” avoidance vector (standard turn/right 15 degrees and climb/descend 500 ft) and report to DECON within 2 minutes.

3. TANKER OPERATIONS
3.1 Air Refueling (AR) Tracks and Control.
- Tanker operations will be conducted on AR tracks promulgated in the ATO-EX. Tracks are identified by AR-EX identifiers with assigned entry/exit points mapped to exercise placeholders (AR-POINT-A through AR-POINT-H).
- Tanker allocation priorities: (1) Combat Air Patrols (CAP) conducting local air defense over POBs and FOSs; (2) CAS and interdiction strikes supporting assigned LOEs; (3) long-range transits for force redeployment.

3.2 AR Track Procedures and Fuel States.
- Pre-contact fuel states: Receiver aircraft shall request AR no later than bingo+20 minutes to allow AR scheduling when SATCOM is intermittent. Minimum safe fuel states are defined in CFT-EX Annex: Bingo fuel = mission-specific baseline published in daily ATO-EX; emergency fuel = 10% below published bingo baseline.
- Controlled breakout: If planned AR cannot be achieved due to contested environment or tanker attrition, the receiver will divert to alternate fuel plan/ELN or execute pre-briefed single-point recovery procedures from the nearest friendly FOS.

3.3 Tanker Self-Protection and Emission Control (EMCON).
- Tankers will operate under EMCON profiles set in ATO-EX. In high-threat sectors, tankers may require escort or CAP over-watch. When escorted, tanker call signs and escort call signs will be coordinated via CAOC and DECON.
- Tanker critical sustainment: CAOC will maintain a minimum theater tanker on-station readiness equivalent to one sortie package per primary axis to ensure continuity of long-range fighter presence.

4. COMBAT SEARCH AND RESCUE (CSAR)
4.1 CSAR Alert Posture and Authority.
- CSAR posture levels are established in CSAR-EX Annex. Default posture for MDJIR: Alert Condition ALPHA (heightened readiness with staffed CSAR mission sets). Escalation to BRAVO/CHARLIE follows Theater threat assessment.
- Tactical control of CSAR assets during initial response resides with the Combined Rescue Coordination Center (CRCC); on-scene tactical coordination is handed to the closest Airborne CSAR Coordinator (A-SARCOORD).

4.2 CSAR Tasking and Execution Procedures.
- CSAR requests will be processed using the standardized PR/ER (Personnel Recovery/Emergency Recovery) format and forwarded through CAOC/CRCC. In degraded comms, use the pre-briefed two-way relay plan: relay via airborne ASW/ISR platform or partner surface unit.
- Minimum CSAR package composition under contested environment: (a) one rescue helicopter UAS-capable (or manned rotary-wing), (b) dedicated escort fighter or armed UAS, (c) on-scene ISR, (d) airborne tanker as needed for persistence.
- Deconfliction: CSAR ingress corridors will be annotated in ACO-EX as CSAR-ROUTES with time-phased exclusivity windows to avoid fratricide.

4.3 CSAR Frequencies and Authentication.
- Primary authentication and beacon protocols for recovery personnel are promulgated in the PR Authentication Appendix. Exercise communications avoid real-world tactical frequencies; instead use EXCON-authenticated crypto callsigns and placeholders. Personnel will carry both radio and visual authentication means.

5. SPACE SUPPORT
5.1 GPS and PNT Degradation Warnings.
- Due to replicated adversary counterspace effects in MDJIR, intermittent GPS/PNT degradation is an exercise baseline. CAOC Space Liaison (SPACELINK) will disseminate Space Situational Awareness (SSA) and GPS Integrity Advisories (GIA-EX) via the Space Support Message (SSM-EX) at least every 4 hours or immediately upon significant events.
- Units must maintain alternate PNT methods: inertial navigation system (INS), map/ground-reference navigation, celestial navigation where trained, and partner-landmark cross-cueing for maritime units.

5.2 SATCOM Prioritization and Contingency.
- SATCOM capacity is constrained to replicate contested conditions. Prioritization order for SATCOM services: (1) Command & Control (C2) for Combined Force Commander and CAOC, (2) CSAR and lifesaving C2, (3) critical targeting C2, (4) logistic movement orders, (5) routine administrative traffic.
- Backup SATCOM: When primary wideband SATCOM is degraded, units will transition to protected narrowband SATCOM and HF/LOS networks per COMMS Annex. SATCOM tasking and priority adjustments are controlled by J6/SPACELINK.

5.3 Overhead ISR/OPIR Data Feeds.
- OPIR (Overhead Persistent Infrared) simulated feeds will be provided to tactical components on a degraded, time-phased basis to replicate contested collection. Feed allocation is by mission priority with CAOC/Space Liaison controlling tasking. Units that require OPIR data for time-sensitive targeting must submit prioritized requests to CAOC using the Time-Sensitive Target (TST) request process.
- OPIR data dissemination uses the Common Operational Picture (COP)-EX and is subject to intermittent data outages. Units must plan alternative ISR cross-cueing using maritime patrol, AEW, and organic sensors.

6. COMMUNICATIONS
6.1 Communications Guidance and Resilient Architecture.
- Communications resilience guidance follows the Theater Communications Resilience Plan (TCRP-EX). Primary C2 links are theater-provided protected IP and MILSATCOM when available; backups include UHF/VHF LOS mesh, HF single-sideband (SSB) for long-range voice, and Allied Tactical Data Links via partner relays.
- Emplace communications redundancy: Units must be able to operate 48–72 hours without strategic SATCOM reachback using local LOS relays, airborne gateways, and pre-positioned data-bursting schedules.

6.2 Primary and Backup Frequencies/Channels (Sanitized).
- To prevent disclosure of operationally sensitive lane frequencies, SPINS lists frequency bands and modality priorities rather than exact channel numbers:
  - Primary C2: Protected MILSATCOM band (X/Ka-band protected service) for commander-to-component C2.
  - Secondary C2: UHF line-of-sight (satcom fallback) for air control, maritime coordination, and CSAR tasking.
  - Tertiary: HF-SSB for long-range voice between theater HQ and deployed ELNs when SATCOM is denied.
  - Data-link: Tactical Data Link family (TADIL/JTIDS-equivalent) for track reporting; connectors should be configured for echeloned relay via airborne and surface nodes.
  - Voice emergency/guard: Units will monitor pre-briefed exercise guard channels and have an HF emergency watch that supports DSN reachback in degraded environments.
- Authentication/callsigns: Use EXCON-authenticated tactical callsigns and one-time authentication codes for the duration of MDJIR. No real national crypto keys are distributed in exercise products.

6.3 Messaging and Network Procedures.
- Emphasize low-probability-of-intercept/low-probability-of-detection (LPI/LPD) techniques: short-burst data, scheduled windows for non-urgent data uplinks, and pre-arranged store-and-forward relay nodes.
- Email and file exchange: Only use official theater Exchange/Share platforms approved in Annex COMMS-EX. Do not transmit target or force movement details over unsecured commercial SATCOM.

6.4 Electronic Warfare (EW) and Emission Control (EMCON).
- Theater EMCON levels are published in daily ATO-EX. All units will implement EMCON discipline consistent with mission requirements and deconfliction with airspace control measures. EW offensive actions require prior coordination with CAOC and decomposition in the EW Synchronization Matrix.

7. JOINT PROCEDURES AND REPORTING
7.1 Daily Battle Rhythm and Reporting.
- The theater daily battle rhythm: ATO-EX release (T-12 hours), ACO-EX release (T-8 hours), SITREP/COMINT/SSA updates at 4-hour intervals, and commanders’ tactical updates at 2-hour increments during heightened operations.
- Significant Event Reports (SITREP-E) for contested-space events, major fires, or damage to critical infrastructure must be formatted per the SITREP-E template and transmitted within 30 minutes via secure relay.

7.2 Targeting and Time-Sensitive Targets (TST).
- Target nomination and approval follow the joint targeting cycle in Annex TARGET-EX. Time-sensitive targeting requests must include PID and collateral risk assessment; if PID is degraded due to contestation, escalate to higher authority.

7.3 Combined/Allied Coordination.
- Liaison officers (LNOs) from key allies/partners are embedded in CAOC, JFMCC, JFACC, J4, J6, and CRCC. Information sharing adheres to standing bilateral/multilateral intell-sharing agreements; any restrictions are annotated in the Combined Sharing Matrix (CSM-EX).

8. SAFETY, LEGAL, AND ACCOUNTABILITY
8.1 Legal Oversight and Counsel.
- Legal counsel (JAG) advisors remain available in CAOC and component HQs to advise on ROE, targeting legal sufficiency, and civilian harm mitigation. All targeting packages require a legal review signature prior to execution unless exigent circumstances are declared.

8.2 Force Protection and OPSEC.
- Force protection measures are maintained per Annex FP-EX. Operational security (OPSEC) procedures restrict release of operational timelines, unit-level ORBAT, and precise location data in unclassified or partner-shared products without EXCON approval.

9. EXERCISE-SPECIFIC REFERENCES AND PLACEHOLDERS
9.1 Definitions and Placeholders.
- All referenced geographic points (POB, FOS, ELN, AR-POINT, GRID-ROZ) are exercise placeholders to be mapped by EXCON. Real-world coordinates and unit identifiers are not included in this SPINS for safety and security.
9.2 Contacts and Reporting Channels.
- EXCON will publish the daily contact matrix (EX-CONTACT-EX) including CAOC, CRCC, J6, J4, and LNO paging/relay procedures. Use EXCON-authenticated channels for all SPINS changes.

10. AMENDMENTS, WAIVERS, AND VALIDITY
10.1 Amendments. This SPINS will be reviewed and, if required, amended every 24 hours or upon significant change in the operational environment. Amendments will be promulgated by CAOC/EXCON.
10.2 Waivers. Requests for waiver to any SPINS paragraph will be submitted through chain-of-command to CAOC for validation and EXCON approval. Waivers that affect ROE, CSAR posture, or ROZs require higher authority concurrence.
10.3 Validity. These SPINS are valid only for the MDJIR exercise period and are explicitly non-executable for real-world operations.

AUTHORITY: Derived from NDS Extract (01 MAR 2026), NMS Theater Annex (01 MAR 2026), JSCP MDJIR (01 MAR 2026), CONPLAN/OPLAN MDJIR (01 MAR 2026). All participants must ensure actions remain consistent with the guiding authorities.

EXERCISE DISCLAIMER: This SPINS deliberately omits operationally sensitive data (real-world unit identifiers, precise geospatial coordinates, and live tactical frequencies). For real-world operations, component commanders will use classified operational SPINS promulgated through secure channels.
