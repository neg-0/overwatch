MEMORANDUM FOR: COMMANDER, UNITED STATES INDO-PACIFIC COMMAND

FROM: CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF

SUBJECT: National Military Strategy (NMS) Theater Annex — Western Pacific (INDOPACOM) Multi-Domain Joint Integration and Resilience (Effective 1–15 March 2026)

DATE: 01 MAR 2026

CLASSIFICATION: UNCLASSIFIED // FOUO


1. PURPOSE.

    a. This National Military Strategy (NMS) Theater Annex provides CJCS military-strategic guidance to Commander, U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (CDRUSINDOPACOM) for the Western Pacific during the effective period 010000Z MAR 2026 through 152359Z MAR 2026. This annex translates national strategic direction into theater-specific military strategic objectives, posture guidance, joint force requirements, and strategic lines of effort (LOEs) suitable to inform subordinate plans, orders, assessments, and exercise design.

    b. This annex is explicitly derived from and implements the “National Defense Strategy (NDS) Extract — Integrated Deterrence and Enduring Advantages in the Western Pacific (Effective 1–15 March 2026),” dated 01 MAR 2026, signed by the Secretary of Defense (hereafter “NDS Extract”). Where this annex provides additional specificity, it remains consistent with the NDS Extract, Chairman’s statutory responsibilities, and joint doctrine, including JP 5-0, Joint Planning; JP 3-0, Joint Operations; JP 1, Doctrine for the Armed Forces of the United States; and CJCSI 3100.01 (Joint Strategic Planning System) principles.

    c. This annex supports a multi-domain joint operation integration exercise with air/maritime/space integration and explicitly accounts for contested logistics, degraded communications, and intermittent satellite coverage. This annex does not direct tactical execution, target lists, or rules of engagement; it provides military-strategic guidance and required effects to shape theater actions and readiness.

    d. Intended downstream users include: USINDOPACOM staff; component commands (PACFLT, PACAF, MARFORPAC, USARPAC, SOCPAC, USFK as applicable); USINDOPACOM JTF HQs; US Space Command (USSPACECOM) supporting elements; U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) supporting elements; Defense Logistics Agency (DLA); U.S. Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM); Missile Defense Agency coordination; and combined/allied headquarters coordinating within applicable agreements.


2. STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENT.

    a. Parent Authority and Strategic Framing. The NDS Extract (01 MAR 2026) establishes national-level priorities for INDOPACOM in the Western Pacific: DENY adversary strategic objectives; PROTECT decision advantage and alliance cohesion; DEGRADE adversary capacity for sustained multi-domain coercion; SUSTAIN forward presence under contested logistics and intermittent space support; and DESTROY adversary confidence in strategic surprise and escalation control. This annex operationalizes those strategic effects into theater military objectives, posture requirements, and joint capability integration guidance, consistent with JP 5-0 and JP 3-0.

    b. Pacing Threat and Operating Conditions. A near-peer state adversary in the Pacific (consistent with the NDS Extract’s pacing threat framing) will employ A2/AD, long-range precision fires, counterspace, cyber, and information operations to delay U.S. response, disrupt C2, and fragment coalition cohesion. The operational environment includes: (1) contested electromagnetic spectrum; (2) cyber threats to mission networks and logistics systems; (3) intermittent PNT and satellite ISR coverage (due to adversary action, environment, and congestion); (4) risks to strategic lift, theater distribution, and key maritime choke points; and (5) persistent influence operations targeting regional populations and allied political decision-making.

    c. Theater Geography and Posture Implications. The Western Pacific’s distances, constrained basing, and concentrated infrastructure increase risk from adversary long-range strike and sabotage. Posture must reduce single points of failure by distributing forces, enabling expeditionary basing, hardening critical nodes, and employing maneuver in multiple domains. JP 3-0 emphasizes that contested environments require resilient C2, protection, and the ability to “fight for information” and “fight through disruption.”

    d. Alliance and Partner Context. The theater’s center of gravity includes political cohesion and operational interoperability among treaty allies and key partners. Execution must align with existing bilateral treaties, Status of Forces Agreements (SOFAs), and access arrangements (including but not limited to those with Japan, the Republic of Korea, Australia, the Philippines, and Thailand), and leverage operational frameworks such as combined planning mechanisms, intelligence-sharing agreements, and cross-servicing/logistics arrangements (e.g., ACSA). Coordination must preserve national caveats while enabling mission command under degraded communications.

    e. Exercise Context (1–15 March 2026). The effective period includes a multi-domain joint integration exercise emphasizing air/maritime/space synchronization, contested logistics, and satellite coverage gaps. Exercise design and supporting operations must validate: (1) distributed and resilient C2; (2) assured logistics under disruption; (3) combined interoperability and rapid information sharing; (4) dynamic force employment and posture adaptation; and (5) disciplined escalation awareness consistent with strategic signaling objectives.


3. STRATEGIC PRIORITIES (THEATER MILITARY STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND REQUIRED EFFECTS).

    1) DENY adversary attainment of strategic objectives through rapid escalation or fait accompli in the Western Pacific.

        a. Theater Military Objective. Establish and demonstrate credible, integrated, and distributed joint force capability—together with allies and partners—to deny the adversary the ability to seize and hold key terrain, isolate allies, or create a short-warning crisis that outpaces U.S./combined decision cycles.

        b. Required Effects (Deny). Deny adversary confidence that it can: (1) achieve operational decision before U.S. reinforcement; (2) neutralize air and maritime power through initial salvos; (3) isolate treaty allies diplomatically and militarily; or (4) paralyze theater response by disrupting a small number of bases, ports, or communications nodes.

        c. Posture Guidance. Maintain a posture mix that supports denial without undue provocation:
            (1) Forward deployed: continuous naval presence (surface, subsurface, maritime patrol) and integrated air and missile defense (IAMD) readiness in coordination with allies; persistent combined maritime domain awareness.
            (2) Rotational: bomber/air expeditionary rotations, rotational surface combatants, and expeditionary advanced basing elements to complicate adversary targeting and increase operational unpredictability.
            (3) Surge capable: ready reinforcement packages and pre-coordinated reception, staging, onward movement, and integration (RSOI) mechanisms to transition rapidly from competition to crisis response.

        d. Joint Force Requirements by Domain.
            (1) Air: resilient sortie generation with dispersed operating locations; contested airspace control procedures per JP 3-52 (Joint Airspace Control) and JP 3-30 (Joint Air Operations); integrated counter-air with allied IAMD; survivable tanker and airlift employment concepts accounting for threatened airfields.
            (2) Maritime: distributed maritime operations; undersea dominance to complicate adversary maritime maneuver; convoy planning and sea line of communications (SLOC) defense measures; coordination with USTRANSCOM for sea/air lift deconfliction.
            (3) Space: prioritized theater support requests for missile warning, protected SATCOM, and alternative PNT solutions; planned operations under intermittent coverage (assumed gaps) with pre-briefed degradations.
            (4) Cyber/EMS: assured mission network continuity and emissions control measures; defensive cyber posture to protect C2 and logistics systems that enable denial.

        e. Justification (Doctrine). JP 3-0 states denial is achieved by credible capability and posture that prevents adversary objectives at acceptable cost/time. JP 5-0 directs planners to translate strategic objectives into achievable end states and tasks while accounting for constraints such as contested basing and communications.

    2) PROTECT U.S. and allied decision advantage, mission command, and coalition cohesion under cyber, electromagnetic, information, and counterspace attack.

        a. Theater Military Objective. Protect the integrity and continuity of theater mission command and shared operational understanding (SOU) across U.S. components and combined partners when primary pathways (SATCOM, ISR feeds, PNT, cloud services, and enterprise logistics systems) are degraded, disrupted, or denied.

        b. Required Effects (Protect). Protect:
            (1) Decision processes: maintain functional joint targeting/collection management, operational assessment, and commander’s decision cycles despite partial information and delayed connectivity.
            (2) C2 pathways: preserve multiple transport layers (SATCOM, LOS, HF, tactical data links, undersea cable-dependent routes where applicable, and assured line-of-sight alternatives) with rehearsed failover.
            (3) Coalition interoperability: maintain combined information-sharing and coordination mechanisms that function with intermittent connectivity and classification constraints; preserve trust through timely, consistent messaging and liaison integration.
            (4) Integrity of logistics and deployment data: protect movement, force tracking, and sustainment systems from manipulation and disruption.

        c. Command and Control Guidance. Consistent with JP 3-0 and JP 6-0 (Joint Communications System), USINDOPACOM will emphasize mission command through:
            (1) Distributed C2 nodes with clear supported/supporting relationships, authorities, and triggers for C2 transition.
            (2) Pre-planned communications windows and data prioritization (mission essential data first) to operate through satellite gaps.
            (3) Robust liaison officer (LNO) architecture with allies/partners and among components to reduce dependence on continuous digital connectivity.
            (4) Information discipline (OPSEC, emission control, and controlled disclosure) to reduce adversary targeting and influence leverage.

        d. Joint Force Requirements by Domain.
            (1) Cyber: defensive cyber operations to secure theater mission networks, logistics systems, and coalition enclaves; incident response playbooks; cyber mission assurance for key C2 nodes.
            (2) Space: coordination with USSPACECOM for threat-informed space support planning; use of protected SATCOM where available; rapid reconfiguration procedures for contested space support.
            (3) Air/Maritime/Land: degraded-mode tactics and procedures (TTPs) for navigation, timing, and targeting; alternative navigation aids; manual or low-bandwidth reporting procedures.

        e. Alliance/Coalition Coordination. Employ standing frameworks (bilateral and multilateral) to ensure continuity:
            (1) Activate combined coordination cells as appropriate; ensure LNO placement in key nodes.
            (2) Utilize existing agreements (SOFAs, ACSA, information-sharing arrangements) to sustain interoperability while respecting national caveats.
            (3) Synchronize strategic communications with allies/partners to counter disinformation and preserve coalition cohesion.

        f. Justification (Doctrine). JP 3-0 emphasizes that information advantage enables operational advantage and that forces must “fight for information.” JP 3-12 (Cyberspace Operations) and JP 6-0 highlight resilient, secure, and redundant communications as essential to mission command. Protecting decision advantage is a strategic effect central to the NDS Extract and a prerequisite to all other theater objectives.

    3) DEGRADE adversary ability to conduct sustained multi-domain coercion by disrupting key enabling functions (sensing, targeting, coordination, and sustainment).

        a. Theater Military Objective. Reduce the adversary’s operational effectiveness by degrading its ability to find, fix, track, target, and engage (F2T2EA) joint and combined forces; degrade its ability to coordinate multi-domain fires and maintain coercive pressure over time.

        b. Required Effects (Degrade). Degrade adversary:
            (1) ISR and targeting quality: reduce accuracy, timeliness, and confidence in targeting solutions through deception, emissions control, maneuver, and counter-reconnaissance.
            (2) Kill chain integration: disrupt synchronization of long-range fires, maritime and air denial, and supporting cyber/electromagnetic activities.
            (3) Sustainment for coercion: reduce adversary capacity to generate sustained operational tempo (e.g., maritime patrol persistence, missile reload/repair cycles) through theater-wide dilemmas and operational uncertainty.
            (4) Narrative leverage: degrade the credibility of coercive messaging by demonstrating coalition resilience and continuity of operations.

        c. Joint Force Requirements by Domain.
            (1) Air: integrated suppression and survivability measures, dynamic targeting processes, and airspace control methods per JP 3-30 and JP 3-52; emphasize low-signature operations and dispersed basing.
            (2) Maritime: operations that complicate adversary maritime ISR and tracking; protection of undersea infrastructure and key maritime routes; layered defense against maritime reconnaissance-strike complexes.
            (3) Space: employ operational concepts that assume intermittent overhead ISR; prioritize time-sensitive space support; integrate commercial and allied space-derived data where authorized and reliable.
            (4) Cyber/EMS: offensive and defensive measures consistent with assigned authorities to disrupt adversary sensing/coordination while safeguarding friendly networks; spectrum awareness to identify and mitigate jamming and spoofing.

        d. Exercise Integration. Ensure the exercise forces realistic degradation: scheduled satellite gaps; contested spectrum injects; cyber incident injects affecting logistics and C2; adversary ISR replication. Validate joint and combined ability to continue operations, assess effects, and adapt.

        e. Justification (Doctrine). JP 3-0 and JP 3-30 emphasize integrated operations to create multiple dilemmas and reduce adversary effectiveness. Degrading enabling functions aligns with the NDS Extract’s emphasis on reducing adversary confidence in A2/AD and coercion without requiring continuous superiority in any single domain.

    4) SUSTAIN the Joint Force and allied/partner operational endurance forward under contested logistics and intermittent space support.

        a. Theater Military Objective. Sustain credible forward presence and the ability to surge and persist combat power by establishing resilient, distributed sustainment and mobility concepts that function under disruption, including attacks on ports, airfields, communications, and fuel/ammunition distribution.

        b. Required Effects (Sustain). Sustain:
            (1) Operational reach: maintain the ability to project and employ combat power despite contested movement corridors and degraded force tracking.
            (2) Endurance: preserve sortie rates, steaming days, and readiness of forward forces with distributed resupply and maintenance.
            (3) Coalition sustainment: enable combined logistics support and mutual aid within existing legal authorities and agreements.
            (4) Reconstitution: restore degraded capabilities (C2 nodes, airfield operations, port throughput, critical spares) at a tempo that prevents adversary exploitation.

        c. Posture and Logistics Guidance. In accordance with JP 4-0 (Joint Logistics), prioritize:
            (1) Distribution and dispersion: reduce reliance on single hubs; pre-position critical munitions, fuel, and spares across multiple locations; employ expeditionary refueling and austere port/airfield operations where feasible.
            (2) Mobility resilience: plan for contested sealift/airlift; rehearse alternate routing; integrate deception and protection measures for high-value logistics assets.
            (3) Data and process resilience: establish manual/alternate procedures for requisition, asset visibility, and movement control when enterprise systems are degraded.
            (4) Medical and personnel sustainment: ensure casualty evacuation, role-echeloning, and personnel replacement plans function under communications constraints and contested air/maritime routes.

        d. Joint Force Requirements by Domain.
            (1) Maritime: afloat logistics protection, underway replenishment resilience, and escort planning; port damage assessment and rapid restoration capabilities.
            (2) Air: agile combat employment support; rapid runway repair; distributed maintenance and munitions handling; fuel distribution redundancy.
            (3) Space/Cyber: protect and provide alternatives for logistics-related PNT and communications; defend logistics information systems from cyber disruption and data integrity attacks.
            (4) Land: theater opening capabilities, expeditionary basing support, and protection of key nodes with integrated air and missile defense as available.

        e. Alliance/Partner Sustainment. Leverage ACSA and bilateral logistics arrangements to expand support options; coordinate host-nation support and contracting within legal constraints; ensure customs, movement permissions, and SOFA-related processes are rehearsed to prevent friction during surge.

        f. Justification (Doctrine). JP 4-0 identifies sustainment as decisive for operational reach and endurance and emphasizes that contested environments require adaptability and protection of sustainment networks. The NDS Extract frames logistics resilience as a strategic advantage necessary to persist forward under disruption and space degradation.

    5) DESTROY adversary confidence in achieving strategic surprise and controlling escalation while preserving U.S. freedom of action and alliance credibility.

        a. Theater Military Objective. Demonstrate credible readiness, rapid transition capability, and combined cohesion such that the adversary assesses it cannot achieve surprise, cannot limit conflict on favorable terms, and cannot fracture alliances through information operations or selective attacks on enabling infrastructure.

        b. Required Effects (Destroy). Destroy adversary confidence that it can:
            (1) Initiate aggression below the threshold of a unified response.
            (2) Paralyze U.S./combined operations via limited strikes against C2, space support, or logistics nodes.
            (3) Control escalation by threatening selective punishment while preventing U.S. denial operations.
            (4) Exploit ambiguity and disinformation to erode allied political will.

        c. Strategic Signaling and Escalation Discipline. Actions during the effective period must be:
            (1) Credible: demonstrate integrated capabilities and continuity of operations under stress.
            (2) Controlled: align with national messaging and avoid inadvertent escalation; maintain transparency with allies/partners to reduce miscalculation.
            (3) Persistent: show that operations continue despite imposed friction (cyber, spectrum, space gaps, logistics disruption).

        d. Readiness and Force Employment Guidance. Use dynamic force employment and distributed posture to complicate adversary planning; rehearse rapid C2 transitions; demonstrate reconstitution of degraded capabilities; integrate allied participation in visible but non-provocative readiness events consistent with political guidance.

        e. Justification (Doctrine). JP 3-0 notes deterrence is strengthened when adversaries perceive the Joint Force can respond rapidly and effectively and can impose unacceptable costs. JP 1 emphasizes unified action with multinational partners. Destroying adversary confidence is a strategic psychological effect achieved through demonstrated resilience, cohesion, and readiness consistent with the NDS Extract.


4. COMMANDER’S INTENT (DERIVED FROM PARENT GUIDANCE).

    a. Purpose. In direct support of the NDS Extract (01 MAR 2026), the purpose of USINDOPACOM actions during 1–15 March 2026 is to strengthen integrated deterrence in the Western Pacific by demonstrating the Joint Force’s ability—together with allies and partners—to deny aggression, protect decision advantage, persist forward under contested logistics and intermittent space support, and rapidly transition from competition to crisis response while maintaining escalation discipline.

    b. Method. USINDOPACOM will achieve this purpose by executing and validating theater campaigning tasks through the following strategic LOEs:

        (1) LOE 1 — Integrated Multi-Domain Command and Control (MDC2) Resilience. Implement distributed mission command, redundant communications paths, and rehearsed C2 transitions; establish common operational picture practices that function under intermittent SATCOM and ISR; and integrate coalition LNO networks to preserve SOU.

        (2) LOE 2 — Combined Denial Posture and Readiness. Employ forward-deployed and rotational forces to demonstrate credible denial capability, including coordinated air and maritime operations, IAMD readiness with allies, and rapid reinforcement drills; emphasize dispersal and survivability.

        (3) LOE 3 — Contested Logistics and Operational Endurance. Execute distribution resilience measures, alternate routing, expeditionary sustainment concepts, and reconstitution drills; validate manual/alternate logistics processes and data integrity measures; coordinate with USTRANSCOM and DLA for stress-tested throughput.

        (4) LOE 4 — Space/Cyber/EMS Degradation Operations and Fight-Through. Plan and operate under assumed satellite coverage gaps and contested spectrum; integrate cyber defense and mission assurance actions protecting C2 and logistics; rehearse degraded-mode navigation and targeting procedures.

        (5) LOE 5 — Alliance Cohesion, Access, and Information Resilience. Synchronize combined planning and information-sharing; rehearse access, basing, and overflight/port clearance processes; coordinate counter-disinformation and public messaging support with appropriate interagency channels and allied counterparts.

    c. Key Tasks (Theater-Strategic Level).
        (1) Validate that USINDOPACOM and components can maintain operationally relevant mission command and execute prioritized tasks under intermittent satellite support for a sustained period (days, not hours).
        (2) Demonstrate distributed posture and the ability to shift combat power and sustainment across multiple nodes without creating single points of failure.
        (3) Exercise combined interoperability under realistic classification and releasability constraints; ensure coalition operations can proceed with partial connectivity and national caveats.
        (4) Demonstrate protection of critical defense relationships by maintaining transparent coordination mechanisms, disciplined signaling, and consistent operational narratives aligned with national objectives.
        (5) Provide CJCS-informed feedback to force development and integration processes consistent with CJCSI 3170.01 (capability requirement alignment), focusing on gaps revealed in contested logistics, C2 resilience, and space-enabled dependency.

    d. Risk and Mitigation.
        (1) Operational Risk: Overreliance on space-enabled services and enterprise networks. Mitigation: enforce planned degradations, prioritize mission-essential data, employ alternate nav/comm, and rehearse manual procedures.
        (2) Strategic Risk: Misinterpretation of readiness activities as escalatory. Mitigation: align with national and allied messaging; employ calibrated visibility; maintain deconfliction channels as directed.
        (3) Coalition Risk: Interoperability shortfalls and information-sharing friction. Mitigation: LNO architecture, pre-coordinated releasability, combined SOPs for degraded comms, and clear supported/supporting relationships.
        (4) Sustainment Risk: Throughput disruption and asset visibility loss. Mitigation: distribute stocks, alternate routing, convoy/escort planning, and redundant tracking methods.

    e. Desired Endstate (Commander’s Intent). At the conclusion of the effective period, the Joint Force—together with allies and partners—has demonstrably improved its ability to deny adversary coercion or rapid escalation; protect decision advantage and mission command; degrade adversary enabling functions by operating unpredictably and resiliently; and sustain forward combat power despite contested logistics and intermittent space support, thereby reinforcing deterrence consistent with the NDS Extract.


5. ENDSTATE.

    a. Deterrence Posture Reinforced. The adversary assesses it cannot achieve strategic objectives rapidly or at acceptable cost due to credible, distributed, and integrated U.S./combined denial capabilities and demonstrated readiness to transition rapidly from competition to crisis response.

    b. Decision Advantage Preserved Under Degradation. USINDOPACOM and components demonstrate mission command continuity and timely decision-making despite imposed satellite coverage gaps, contested spectrum, and cyber/logistics disruptions; coalition coordination remains functional through redundant pathways and LNO integration.

    c. Adversary Coercion Capacity Reduced in Practical Terms. The Joint Force demonstrates operational patterns, dispersal, emissions control, and multi-domain coordination that reduce adversary ISR/targeting confidence and complicate planning for sustained coercive pressure.

    d. Forward Endurance Validated. Theater sustainment concepts prove capable of supporting forward presence and surge operations with distributed stocks, alternate routing, and reconstitution procedures; combined logistics arrangements are exercised and improved within existing legal authorities and agreements.

    e. Alliance Cohesion and Access Strengthened. Allies and partners demonstrate effective combined interoperability, access/basing processes, and coordinated messaging; political confidence is reinforced by visible operational competence and disciplined escalation management.

    f. Capability and Planning Feedback Produced. USINDOPACOM provides CJCS-ready observations and recommendations identifying capability gaps, policy/process friction points, and priority investments—particularly in resilient C2, contested logistics, space support alternatives, and coalition interoperability—consistent with CJCSI 3170.01 and joint lessons learned processes.
