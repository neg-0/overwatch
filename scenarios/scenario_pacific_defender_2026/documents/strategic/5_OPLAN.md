NOTE (FOR EXERCISE DESIGN / NON-EXECUTABLE): This OPLAN is a notional exercise-planning document intended to guide simulation design, staff battle drills, and readiness assessment under JP 5-0. It deliberately avoids real-world unit identifiers, installation names, precise movement timelines, routing, and other execution-level details that could be misused. Locations are expressed as “Primary Operating Base (POB), Forward Operating Site (FOS),” and “Expeditionary Logistics Node (ELN)” placeholders to be mapped by the exercise control group (EXCON) to the “available real-world bases in theater” list (not provided in the tasking message).

1. (U) SITUATION.

   a. (U) General. From 010000Z MAR 2026 through 152359Z MAR 2026, USINDOPACOM conducts MDJIR in the Western Pacific to validate joint force integration and resilience in a contested information environment characterized by intermittent satellite communications (SATCOM) coverage gaps, degraded position/navigation/timing (PNT), data-link interference, and contested logistics. The exercise replicates a near-peer Pacific adversary’s A2/AD effects through simulated injects and adjudicated outcomes; it does not constitute a real-world contingency and does not authorize lethal operations.

   b. (U) Adversary forces (exercise replication). The adversary is modeled as a near-peer state actor capable of: long-range anti-ship and land-attack strike complexes; integrated air and missile defense (IAMD) effects; maritime and undersea disruption of sea lines of communication (SLOC); cyber operations focused on logistics and unclassified networks; electronic attack affecting tactical data links and GPS; and reversible counterspace interference producing intermittent SATCOM outages and ISR degradation. The adversary’s most likely approach during MDJIR is to contest decision advantage by attempting to disrupt joint C2 continuity and degrade distribution throughput (fuel, munitions, and mission-essential spares) by targeting visible nodes and data systems.

   c. (U) Friendly forces.

      (1) Supported commander. CDRUSINDOPACOM is supported for MDJIR execution.

      (2) Supporting commanders and components. PACFLT, PACAF, MARFORPAC, USARPAC, SOCPAC, and supporting USSPACECOM/USCYBERCOM (and Service cyber/space components) provide forces and capabilities to execute the exercise objectives consistent with apportionment and standing authorities.

      (3) Combined/allied/partner forces (exercise). Participation is governed by existing agreements and national caveats. Combined coordination is assumed to include limited shared airspace control measures where authorized; information-sharing with releasability constraints; intermittent connectivity; and partner operations with partial data feeds and separate mission networks.

   d. (U) Assumptions.

      (1) Access, basing, and overflight are available consistent with standing agreements; EXCON will apply delays, partial denials, or restrictions as injects to stress planning and re-planning.
      (2) Satellite coverage gaps occur in multiple windows (hours-to-days) and require C2/ISR/PNT degradation battle drills.
      (3) Cyber incidents affect primarily non-classified and mission support networks (e.g., movement and distribution visibility, maintenance and supply transactions), forcing manual reversion and data integrity validation.
      (4) No real-world rules of engagement (ROE) changes are implied. “Fires” and “effects” are simulated and adjudicated.

   e. (U) Constraints and restraints.

      (1) Constraint: Operations are executed as an exercise with simulated effects; no lethal targeting, no real-world kinetic action.
      (2) Restraint: Protect partner information and comply with releasability rules; employ minimum necessary classification; maintain operations security (OPSEC) consistent with exercise play.

   f. (U) Operational environment considerations.

      (1) Geography/tyranny of distance. Distributed basing and long-range maritime maneuver impose time-distance constraints on sorties, refueling, and sealift; these factors will be used to stress endurance and recovery timelines.
      (2) Infrastructure limitations. Austere locations have constrained ramp space, fuel storage, cargo handling, and air defense capacity; throughput limits will be modeled and measured.
      (3) Information environment. Periodic loss of beyond-line-of-sight (BLOS) transport and degraded PNT require disciplined emissions control (EMCON), alternate comm paths (HF, LOS relay, mesh), and mission command.

2. (U) MISSION.

USINDOPACOM conducts MDJIR (010000Z MAR 2026 through 152359Z MAR 2026) in the Western Pacific to demonstrate and assess multi-domain joint force integration and resilience by: (1) sustaining distributed air and maritime combat power generation under contested logistics; (2) maintaining mission command and coalition coordination under intermittent SATCOM coverage gaps, degraded PNT, and cyber/EMS disruption; and (3) producing a readiness assessment and capability gap recommendations to CJCS/OSD NLT 151800Z MAR 2026 in accordance with JP 5-0, JP 3-0, JP 3-52, JP 4-0, JP 6-0, JP 3-12, and CJCSI 3170.01.

3. (U) EXECUTION.

   a. (U) Commander’s Intent.

      (1) Purpose. Validate that the joint force can preserve decision advantage and operational endurance in the Western Pacific while operating from a distributed posture and under degraded space/cyber/EMS conditions.

      (2) Method. Employ a theater-wide distributed C2 architecture with pre-planned failovers; integrate PACFLT maritime maneuver with PACAF Agile Combat Employment (ACE) and dynamic airspace control; employ expeditionary logistics nodes and afloat sustainment protection; conduct repeated battle drills for SATCOM/PNT/data-link loss; and stress the distribution enterprise using injects (access delays, data integrity compromise, and throughput constraints). Execute mission-type orders and commander’s intent-driven control when connectivity is degraded, consistent with JP 3-0 and JP 6-0.

      (3) End state. Joint force demonstrates: (a) credible denial posture through distributed basing and integrated maritime maneuver; (b) continuous C2 despite intermittent SATCOM/ISR/PNT; (c) sustainment throughput sufficient to maintain planned sortie and presence rates with measured recovery timelines; (d) coalition coordination functioning under partial data; and (e) documented lessons learned and capability gap recommendations delivered to CJCS/OSD by 151800Z MAR 2026.

   b. (U) Scheme of Maneuver.

      (1) Operational approach. MDJIR executes through five compressed phases aligned to JP 3-0. Maneuver is executed across air and maritime domains with enabling space/cyber and a contested logistics problem set. “Maneuver” in this exercise emphasizes posture, dispersal, protection, and the ability to reconstitute and continue operations rather than offensive destruction.

      (2) Phasing construct (time-bound for exercise control; specific event timing is scenario-driven and may flex).

         Phase 0 — SHAPE (01–02 MAR 2026): Establish resilient execution conditions.
         Objectives:
           (a) Stand up distributed C2 (primary/alternate/contingency/emergency) with failover triggers and communications playbooks.
           (b) Posture air and maritime forces to distributed locations; validate ACE site certification packages and airfield/port operating constraints.
           (c) Establish combined coordination mechanisms and releasability pathways; rehearse cross-domain coordination cells.
           (d) Confirm logistics baselines: fuel, munitions, spares, medical, and intra-theater lift availability; validate manual reversion procedures.

         Phase I — DETER / DISPERSE (03–05 MAR 2026): Demonstrate denial posture and complicate adversary targeting.
         Objectives:
           (a) Execute ACE dispersal to multiple FOS/CLs (contingency locations) with signature management measures.
           (b) Establish maritime maneuver patterns supporting SLOC defense and distributed sea-based logistics.
           (c) Initiate airspace control continuity drills (ACO/ACM procedures) under degraded data links.
           (d) Begin contested logistics injects (limited access, throughput reduction, cyber impacts to tracking systems).

         Phase II — CONTEST C2 / LOGISTICS (06–09 MAR 2026): Operate through SATCOM gaps and cyber/EMS disruption.
         Objectives:
           (a) Execute pre-planned C2 failovers (JFACC/JFMCC/JFLCC supporting nodes) and demonstrate mission continuation on mission-type orders.
           (b) Employ alternate comms (HF, LOS relay, airborne gateway, tactical chat equivalents) and prioritize protected SATCOM when available.
           (c) Validate degraded PNT procedures (alternate nav, timing discipline, TACAN/ILS where applicable, celestial/INS practices as simulated).
           (d) Continue sorties/presence while sustaining distribution under compromised data integrity (manual verification, reconciliation, controlled release of parts/fuel).

         Phase III — REGAIN TEMPO / RECONSTITUTE (10–13 MAR 2026): Recover and sustain operational tempo after disruption.
         Objectives:
           (a) Reconstitute C2 systems and data integrity; restore common operational picture (COP) with confidence scoring and provenance.
           (b) Execute rapid airfield/base recovery drills (simulated damage, runway/ramp constraints) and adjust sortie generation plan.
           (c) Demonstrate convoy/escort planning and at-sea sustainment protection; manage risk to high-value logistics shipping.
           (d) Conduct integrated air/maritime “presence surges” within realistic tanker and sustainment constraints.

         Phase IV — ASSESS / TRANSITION (14–15 MAR 2026): Capture lessons, assess readiness, provide recommendations.
         Objectives:
           (a) Collect measures of effectiveness (MOE) and measures of performance (MOP) across C2 continuity, sortie rates, logistics throughput, and coalition coordination.
           (b) Produce capability gap recommendations (DOTMLPF-P) consistent with CJCSI 3170.01.
           (c) Transition to steady-state posture and complete after-action reporting to CJCS/OSD NLT 151800Z MAR 2026.

      (3) Joint air scheme (exercise). The JFACC (as designated by CDRUSINDOPACOM) will execute a notional ATO cycle with deliberate “degraded cycle” drills: shortened planning windows, partial data, and manual coordination. Primary air tasks include defensive counterair (DCA), maritime strike integration (simulated), ISR presence (simulated feeds with dropouts), tanker management under threat replication, aeromedical evacuation rehearsal, and intra-theater lift for ACE.

      (4) Joint maritime scheme (exercise). The JFMCC (as designated) will employ distributed maritime operations constructs to: protect SLOCs; escort logistics shipping; conduct undersea coordination; and provide sea-based sustainment and C2 redundancy. Maneuver emphasizes complicating adversary ISR, maintaining logistics flow, and enabling air operations via afloat refueling/rearming where exercised.

      (5) Space/cyber/EMS integration. USSPACECOM support will prioritize protected SATCOM allocation during windows of interference, coordinate alternate ISR dissemination paths, and lead PNT degradation battle drills. USCYBERCOM/Service cyber will prioritize defensive cyber operations (DCO), incident response, and data integrity restoration for movement/distribution and mission planning systems. EMS management will emphasize spectrum deconfliction, emissions discipline, and preplanned comm windows.

      (6) Coordinating instructions (exercise-wide).
         (a) Decision points: C2 failover triggers; shift from network-dependent control to mission-type orders; logistics release authorities under data uncertainty; airspace control under data-link degradation.
         (b) Risk acceptance: Use commander-approved risk matrices for tanker employment, high-value maritime logistics exposure, and communications emissions.
         (c) Measures: Track C2 uptime by node; time-to-failover; sortie generation vs. plan; fuel days-of-supply at POB/FOS/ELN; mean time to restore logistics data confidence; convoy cycle times; and coalition information-sharing timeliness.

4. (U) FIRES (EXERCISE EFFECTS, TARGETING PRIORITIES, ROE CONSTRAINTS).

   a. (U) Purpose. Fires in MDJIR are simulated and focused on training the joint targeting process, cross-domain effects synchronization, and command decision-making under uncertainty, consistent with JP 3-0 and joint targeting doctrine, without generating real-world target lists.

   b. (U) Targeting priorities (effects-based, non-kinetic/kinetic simulated).

      Priority 1: Preserve joint force mission command.
      (1) Protect primary/alternate C2 nodes; maintain communications pathways; ensure airspace control continuity.
      (2) Prioritize counter-ISR and deception/survivability effects (exercise injects) to reduce adversary targeting confidence.

      Priority 2: Sustain distributed combat power generation.
      (1) Protect/restore logistics nodes (fuel distribution, munitions handling, spares pipelines) and maintain acceptable throughput.
      (2) Prioritize base recovery and continuity effects to restore sortie generation after simulated strikes.

      Priority 3: Protect SLOCs and high-value logistics shipping.
      (1) Integrate maritime escort, air cover, and undersea coordination (exercise) to reduce logistics interruption.
      (2) Prioritize detection and tracking of simulated adversary maritime threats in key transit areas.

      Priority 4: Demonstrate credible denial posture.
      (1) Execute integrated air/maritime presence and responsive maneuver to complicate adversary planning.
      (2) Conduct simulated long-range and maritime strike integration events for staff proficiency, without real-world targeting.

      (7) Tanker task force: Approximately 12–18x tanker aircraft (KC-46/KC-135-class mix) staged primarily from POB-5 with contingency operations from POB-2 as required. Primary mission: enable fighter persistence and mobility, execute tanker risk management under threat replication, and rehearse comm-degraded rendezvous, alternates, and recovery.

      (8) Combat support enablers: Contingency response, civil engineering, EOD, security forces, medical, and communications packages sufficient to open/operate 3–4 FOS sites and 1–2 ELNs concurrently. These teams will be distributed with a hub-and-spoke concept, emphasizing minimum essential footprint and rapid displacement.

   b. (U) Maritime domain forces (notional).

      (1) Carrier Strike Group (CSG-1) (notional): One aircraft carrier with an embarked carrier air wing of approximately 44–50 aircraft (fighter, electronic attack, airborne early warning, rotary wing) operating in a broad maneuver area east of the First Island Chain (exact operating areas determined by EXCON for scenario realism). Primary mission: provide sea-based airpower generation, contribute to air defense and maritime presence, and serve as a resilient C2 and logistics node when shore basing is constrained.

      (2) Expeditionary Strike Group (ESG-1) (notional): One amphibious assault ship (LHA/LHD-class) with a notional embarked Marine air-ground task force (MAGTF) element and a composite aviation detachment (approximately 16–20 aircraft/tiltrotor/rotary wing mix).

      (3) Spectrum operations cell: A joint EMS cell to coordinate spectrum deconfliction, EW inject responses, and comm windows discipline.

6. (U) LOGISTICS (CONTESTED DISTRIBUTION EMPHASIS; JP 4-0).

   a. (U) Concept. Sustainment will be executed via a distributed support concept that combines: (1) a limited number of POB hubs with higher-capacity stockage and maintenance; (2) multiple FOS locations supported by “push packages” and scheduled resupply; (3) ELNs for transload, refuel, and limited repair; and (4) afloat sustainment to reduce reliance on fixed shore nodes. The logistics scheme is designed to function with degraded asset visibility, intermittent communications, and compromised data integrity.

   b. (U) Priorities of sustainment.
      (1) POL (aviation fuel, ship fuel) distribution continuity and storage resilience.
      (2) Munitions handling and safe storage (simulated expenditure accounting).
      (3) Mission-critical spares for sortie generation (engines, tires/brakes, avionics line replaceable units).
      (4) Medical readiness and casualty care (exercise scenarios).
      (5) Base operating support for ACE sites (power, water, airfield services, security).

   c. (U) Distribution and movement (exercise).
      (1) Use a layered delivery model: scheduled airlift to POB hubs; onward distribution by intra-theater lift to FOS/ELN; and sealift for heavy sustainment with convoy/escort rehearsals.
      (2) Implement “data integrity gates” for release of high-risk shipments when logistics IT systems are degraded: manual validation, two-person verification, and reconciliation with physical inventories.
      (3) Plan for surge-and-recover logistics rhythms rather than constant flow during Phase II (SATCOM gaps), emphasizing prepositioned push packages and local stockage.

   d. (U) Maintenance and repair.
      (1) Emphasize forward maintenance limited to safe, high-payoff tasks; evacuate complex repairs to POB hubs or afloat capability as exercised.
      (2) Use cannibalization controls and strict configuration management when automated systems are unavailable.

   e. (U) Medical.
      (1) Provide role-based care at POB hubs with forward aid capability at FOS/ELN; rehearse aeromedical evacuation under comm-degraded conditions and alternate routing.
      (2) Implement medical logistics tracking with manual back-up and daily reconciliation.

   f. (U) Contracting and host-nation support (exercise).
      (1) Employ host-nation support within agreements; EXCON may replicate disruptions (labor constraints, access limits).
      (2) Contracting officers will rehearse continuity under cyber incidents affecting payment, ordering, and vendor communications (exercise injects only).

   g. (U) Logistics reporting (battle rhythm).
      (1) Establish a minimum essential logistics reporting set that can be transmitted via low-bandwidth means during SATCOM gaps.
      (2) Require daily (or event-driven) commander’s critical information requirements (CCIR)-linked logistics updates: fuel state, sortie capability, munitions posture (simulated), and distribution delays.

7. (U) COMMAND AND CONTROL (JP 6-0; JP 3-52).

   a. (U) C2 architecture. MDJIR employs a distributed mission command construct: a primary Joint Operations Center (JOC), an alternate JOC, and component operations centers with preplanned succession and failover. The JFACC/JFMCC/JFLCC (as designated) maintain mission execution capability when connectivity to the primary JOC is degraded.

   b. (U) C2 objectives.
      (1) Maintain continuity of command and clarity of commander’s intent under degraded communications.
      (2) Preserve airspace control and safety of flight under intermittent data links.
      (3) Maintain a credible COP with confidence scoring and provenance tracking.

   c. (U) Communications plan (resilience).
      (1) Primary communications: standard theater networks as available (exercise).
      (2) Alternate communications: HF voice/data, LOS relays, airborne gateway/relay concepts, courier/physical transfer for critical products when required, and preplanned comm windows.
      (3) Emergency communications: minimum essential voice nets and brevity procedures; pre-coordinated lost-comm execution checklists at unit level.

   d. (U) Airspace control (JP 3-52).
      (1) The ACO will include degraded operations annexes: procedural control measures, preplanned ACMs, and positive/procedural transition triggers.
      (2) Emphasize deconfliction between mobility, tanker tracks, maritime patrol, and fighter packages during data-link degradation events.

   e. (U) Cyber defense and network operations (JP 3-12).
      (1) Establish a joint cyber battle rhythm integrated with J6: detection, containment, eradication, recovery, and after-action.
      (2) Implement “assume breach” procedures for mission support systems: segmentation, least-privilege access, and manual reversion rehearsals.

   f. (U) Space support coordination.
      (1) Space support element will recommend protected SATCOM prioritization and alternate routing; coordinate PNT degradation responses; and support ISR dissemination alternatives.
      (2) Implement PNT contingency procedures across air, maritime, and land components, with explicit timing discipline for distributed C2 nodes.

   g. (U) Reporting and assessment.
      (1) Components will report MOE/MOP in accordance with the MDJIR assessment plan: C2 continuity metrics, logistics throughput and recovery, sortie generation, maritime escort effectiveness (exercise), and coalition information-sharing timeliness.
      (2) USINDOPACOM J5 will consolidate lessons learned and capability gap recommendations consistent with CJCSI 3170.01 and deliver the final assessment to CJCS/OSD NLT 151800Z MAR 2026.

COORDINATING INSTRUCTIONS:
