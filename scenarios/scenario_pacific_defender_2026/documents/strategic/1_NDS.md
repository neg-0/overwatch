MEMORANDUM FOR: COMMANDER, UNITED STATES INDO-PACIFIC COMMAND

FROM: SECRETARY OF DEFENSE

SUBJECT: National Defense Strategy (NDS) Extract — Integrated Deterrence and Enduring Advantages in the Western Pacific (Effective 1–15 March 2026)

DATE: 01 MAR 2026

CLASSIFICATION: UNCLASSIFIED // FOUO


1. PURPOSE.

    a. This memorandum provides a National Defense Strategy (NDS) extract to guide U.S. INDOPACOM’s strategic framing, prioritization, and alignment of joint and combined activities in the Western Pacific during the effective period. This extract informs downstream plans and products while remaining national-level in scope and intent.

    b. This NDS extract translates national defense priorities into theater-relevant strategic effects. It is intended to align Department of Defense (DoD) posture, campaigning, and readiness investments with integrated deterrence, crisis resilience, and the protection of U.S. strategic interests. It emphasizes joint force credibility under conditions of contested logistics, intermittent space support, and adversary efforts to disrupt U.S. command and control, sensing, and sustainment networks.

    c. This guidance does not direct specific operations, targeting, or tactical employment. It provides strategic priorities and desired strategic effects consistent with the NDS and joint doctrine to inform planning, force development advocacy, and coordination with allies and partners.

2. STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENT.

    a. Parent Strategic Guidance. This extract is derived from and must be read consistent with the “2022 National Defense Strategy of the United States of America,” including its central concepts of (1) integrated deterrence, (2) campaigning, and (3) building enduring advantages. It also aligns with the Chairman’s role in translating strategy to military advice and planning through joint doctrine and guidance, including “Joint Publication (JP) 5-0, Joint Planning,” and “JP 3-0, Joint Operations.”

    b. Pacing Threat. The People’s Republic of China (PRC) remains the pacing threat for the Department of Defense. The PRC’s modernization and coercive regional behavior—paired with its growing capacity to contest U.S. military advantages across air, maritime, cyber, and space domains—constitute the most consequential and systemic challenge to U.S. national security in the Western Pacific. The PRC’s strategy seeks to achieve regional hegemony, undermine allied cohesion, restrict freedom of action, and alter the status quo through intimidation, gray-zone activity, and potential rapid escalation designed to present the United States and allies with a fait accompli.

    c. Acute and Persistent Threats. While the PRC is the pacing threat, other actors can create acute crises that stress U.S. capacity, readiness, and decision-making. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) retains the ability to generate rapid escalation through missile and WMD-related activities. Russia remains disruptive through opportunistic military and information activities, including strategic messaging, undersea and long-range strike developments, and arms cooperation that can indirectly affect theater risk. Violent extremist organizations and transnational criminal networks continue to exploit seams, particularly in the maritime domain, and can complicate access, basing, and partner capacity.

    d. Strategic Conditions in the Western Pacific. The Western Pacific is a core geography for U.S. national defense due to: (1) treaty alliances and defense commitments; (2) globally significant sea lines of communication; (3) concentration of high-technology industrial capacity; and (4) the region’s centrality to global economic stability. The strategic environment is characterized by increasing adversary investments in anti-access/area denial (A2/AD), long-range precision fires, air and maritime integrated air defense systems, counterspace capabilities, cyber operations, and information operations intended to fracture alliances and delay U.S. mobilization and employment.

    e. Contestation of Logistics and Space. The United States must assume that any major contingency in the Western Pacific will be marked by contested logistics, degraded communications, intermittent positioning/navigation/timing, and reduced space-based ISR availability—whether from adversary action, environmental factors, or congestion and disruption in the electromagnetic spectrum. Strategic resilience therefore requires designing forces, posture, and sustainment concepts that remain effective when satellite coverage is intermittent and when theater distribution networks face persistent disruption.

    f. Strategic Interests. U.S. strategic interests in the Western Pacific include: deterring aggression; preserving the sovereignty and security of allies and partners; maintaining freedom of navigation and overflight consistent with international law; protecting U.S. citizens and the homeland from coercion or attack; sustaining an open, rules-based international order; ensuring the security of undersea infrastructure and critical digital connectivity; and preventing adversary control of key terrain, chokepoints, and information networks that would enable coercion at scale.

    g. National Approach: Integrated Deterrence, Campaigning, Enduring Advantages. The NDS directs the Department to deter, and if necessary prevail, by integrating capabilities across domains and with allies and partners; campaigning day-to-day to shape the environment and reduce risk of conflict; and building enduring advantages in the defense industrial base, logistics resilience, munitions, training, and command and control. In INDOPACOM, these themes require credible forward posture, resilient sustainment, adaptable C2, and combined interoperability—without overreliance on a single domain, platform, or infrastructure node.

3. STRATEGIC PRIORITIES.

    The following strategic priorities establish national-level effects to be achieved by DoD components operating in the Western Pacific. These effects are expressed using joint doctrinal terms and are intended to guide theater campaigning, posture, security cooperation, and contingency preparedness. Commanders will ensure these priorities are reflected in plans and assessments consistent with “JP 5-0, Joint Planning,” and executed through integrated joint actions as described in “JP 3-0, Joint Operations.” The effects below should be pursued in coordination with interagency partners and in concert with allies and partners consistent with integrated deterrence.

    (1) DENY adversary attainment of strategic objectives through coercion or rapid escalation in the Western Pacific.

        (a) Effect. Deny the PRC the ability to achieve a fait accompli against U.S. allies and partners or to unilaterally change the status quo through coercion, gray-zone aggression, or limited use of force. Deny adversary confidence that it can control escalation, isolate allies, or delay U.S. response through attacks on C2, logistics, or space-enabled advantages.

        (b) Justification (Doctrine). “JP 3-0, Joint Operations” emphasizes that deterrence and compellence rely on the credible capability and will to deny an adversary’s objectives and impose costs. “JP 5-0, Joint Planning” directs planners to translate strategic objectives into achievable military end states and to account for adversary centers of gravity, objectives, and risk. Denial in this context is a strategic effect achieved by credible posture, resilient command and control, and combined readiness that convinces the pacing threat it cannot achieve objectives at acceptable cost or within acceptable time.

        (c) Strategic Emphasis. Denial requires: (i) integrated air and missile defense posture and readiness with allies; (ii) combined maritime domain awareness; (iii) credible conventional deterrent options that can function under degraded space support; and (iv) persistent campaigning that strengthens political cohesion and demonstrates the ability to fight through disruption.

    (2) PROTECT U.S. and allied decision advantage, mission command, and critical defense relationships against multi-domain disruption.

        (a) Effect. Protect the integrity and continuity of joint and combined command and control, including decision processes, communications pathways, and shared operational understanding, against adversary cyber, electromagnetic spectrum, information, and counterspace actions. Protect alliance cohesion and partner confidence by ensuring combined interoperability and reliable coordination mechanisms during crisis and competition.

        (b) Justification (Doctrine). “JP 3-0” underscores that effective operations require information advantage and resilient C2 across the range of military operations. “JP 6-0, Joint Communications System,” and “JP 3-12, Cyberspace Operations,” highlight the need for resilient, secure, and redundant communications and cyber defense to sustain mission command. Although tactical execution is left to the combatant commander, the national strategic effect is protection of decision advantage—ensuring the Joint Force can coordinate, adapt, and act faster than the adversary under contested conditions.

        (c) Strategic Emphasis. Protecting decision advantage entails emphasizing: (i) distributed and resilient C2 architectures; (ii) assured communications and navigation alternatives; (iii) counter-disinformation coordination with interagency and allies; and (iv) strengthened operational-level interoperability and information-sharing arrangements that can persist during satellite coverage gaps and communications degradation.

    (3) DEGRADE adversary capacity to conduct sustained multi-domain coercion and to hold U.S. forces and partners at risk.

        (a) Effect. Degrade the PRC’s ability to employ integrated multi-domain effects—particularly long-range precision strike, maritime and air denial, cyber disruption, and counterspace operations—that threaten U.S. forces, allies, and regional stability. Degrade adversary confidence in the effectiveness of its A2/AD posture by reducing its ability to generate accurate targeting, persistent ISR, and coordinated multi-domain fires.

        (b) Justification (Doctrine). “JP 3-0” describes defeating adversary systems through the coordinated application of joint capabilities to create multiple dilemmas and reduce adversary effectiveness. “JP 3-30, Joint Air Operations,” and “JP 3-52, Joint Airspace Control,” provide doctrinal foundations for integrating air capabilities and airspace control to achieve strategic and operational effects, including suppression of adversary systems that enable attacks and coercion. At the national strategic level, degrading key enabling functions—sensing, targeting, coordination, and sustainment of adversary multi-domain operations—supports deterrence by complicating planning, increasing uncertainty, and lowering adversary expectations of success.

        (c) Strategic Emphasis. Degradation, as a strategic objective, prioritizes: (i) partner and ally capabilities that complicate adversary targeting and operations; (ii) collective readiness to operate in a contested electromagnetic environment; and (iii) joint and combined integration that reduces single points of failure and limits adversary opportunities to exploit seams between domains or national authorities.

    (4) SUSTAIN the Joint Force and allied/partner capacity to persist forward under contested logistics and intermittent space support.

        (a) Effect. Sustain credible forward presence and the ability to surge and persist combat power by ensuring that logistics, basing access, mobility, and industrial support can function despite disruption. Sustain alliance operational endurance by improving combined logistics compatibility, pre-crisis coordination mechanisms, and distributed sustainment concepts that reduce vulnerability to attacks on centralized nodes.

        (b) Justification (Doctrine). “JP 4-0, Joint Logistics,” stresses that operational reach and endurance are enabled by logistics and that contested environments require adaptability, distribution, and protection of sustainment networks. “JP 5-0” emphasizes identifying constraints and restraints, assessing risk, and ensuring feasibility in planning. The NDS emphasis on building enduring advantages and campaigning requires logistics resilience as a strategic advantage, not merely an enabling function.

        (c) Strategic Emphasis. Sustainment at the strategic level requires: (i) resilient distribution and stockpiling concepts aligned with theater posture; (ii) munitions and critical spares readiness; (iii) agreements and processes that enable combined sustainment with allies and partners; and (iv) improved ability to operate effectively with reduced reliance on continuous satellite support.

    (5) DESTROY adversary confidence in achieving strategic surprise and in controlling escalation, while preserving U.S. freedom of action and credibility.

        (a) Effect. Destroy adversary confidence that it can initiate aggression without timely, coordinated U.S. and allied response; destroy the perceived benefits of limited aggression, coercive escalation, or attacks on enabling infrastructure. This effect is psychological and strategic: it is achieved by demonstrating credible, integrated capabilities; unified alliance signaling; and the capacity to reconstitute and continue operations after disruption.

        (b) Justification (Doctrine). “JP 3-0” notes that deterrence is strengthened when adversaries perceive that U.S. forces can respond rapidly and effectively and can impose unacceptable costs. “JP 1, Doctrine for the Armed Forces of the United States,” emphasizes the importance of unified action with interagency and multinational partners to achieve national objectives. At the national level, destroying adversary confidence supports crisis stability and reduces incentives for preemption or escalation based on miscalculation.

        (c) Strategic Emphasis. This effect is advanced by: (i) credible readiness signals that demonstrate combined capability without unnecessary provocation; (ii) improved ability to operate through degraded information environments; and (iii) visible alliance cohesion, including integrated planning and shared understanding of the threat.

4. COMMANDER’S INTENT.

    a. Purpose. Derived directly from the “2022 National Defense Strategy of the United States of America,” the purpose of DoD efforts in the Western Pacific is to deter the pacing threat, reinforce allied and partner confidence, and preserve a free and open Indo-Pacific by integrating joint and combined capabilities to prevent aggression and ensure that the United States can prevail if deterrence fails.

    b. Method. Consistent with NDS priorities of integrated deterrence, campaigning, and enduring advantages, U.S. INDOPACOM will:

        (1) Integrate across domains and with allies and partners to present the pacing threat with multiple, simultaneous dilemmas—particularly under conditions of contested logistics, degraded communications, and intermittent space support—thereby reducing adversary confidence in a rapid, decisive action.

        (2) Campaign persistently to strengthen alliances and partnerships, expand interoperability, and reduce the probability of conflict by shaping adversary decision-making and reinforcing international norms, including freedom of navigation and overflight.

        (3) Build and demonstrate enduring advantages in posture resilience, logistics endurance, information security, and combined command and control. These advantages must be designed to persist when key space-enabled services are degraded or disrupted.

        (4) Maintain strategic discipline: preserve escalation control, ensure actions are consistent with U.S. law and international obligations, and align messaging and force posture with national objectives to avoid inadvertent escalation while sustaining credible deterrence.

    c. Key Tasks (Strategic-Level). The following strategic tasks guide theater alignment without prescribing operational detail:

        (1) Ensure theater posture and coordination mechanisms enable rapid transition from competition to crisis response while preserving alliance cohesion and political decision space.

        (2) Strengthen combined resilience against adversary information operations, cyber disruption, and counterspace activity that target decision-making and coalition unity.

        (3) Advance sustainment resilience as a strategic advantage by prioritizing distributed support concepts, redundancy, and interoperability with allied and partner logistics systems.

        (4) Support joint force readiness and modernization priorities consistent with “CJCSI 3170.01” principles for capability requirement alignment, ensuring that capability development and integration activities reinforce deterrence and operational resilience in the Western Pacific.

    d. Risk and Restraints. The pacing threat benefits from ambiguity, speed, and attempts to fragment coalitions. U.S. efforts must avoid creating unnecessary strategic ambiguity among allies, must protect sensitive capabilities and sources, and must ensure that demonstrations of readiness do not undermine broader national objectives. Risk will be managed through disciplined escalation awareness, robust coordination with allies and the interagency, and continued emphasis on resilience rather than dependence on vulnerable nodes.

    e. Desired Strategic Posture. The Joint Force will be perceived—by allies, partners, and the pacing threat—as credible, cohesive, and capable of sustained operations despite multi-domain disruption. The theater will be positioned to deny aggression, protect allied sovereignty, and maintain freedom of navigation and overflight, while sustaining the industrial and logistics base required for prolonged competition and potential conflict.

5. ENDSTATE.

    a. The United States, in concert with allies and partners, has established a stable deterrence posture in the Western Pacific in which the PRC is deterred from aggression and coercion because it assesses it cannot achieve its strategic objectives rapidly or at acceptable cost.

    b. U.S. treaty allies and key security partners possess increased confidence in U.S. commitments and improved combined interoperability, including resilient coordination and sustainment mechanisms that function under contested communications and intermittent space support.

    c. Freedom of navigation and overflight consistent with international law is preserved; critical sea lines of communication and undersea infrastructure are protected; and regional states retain political autonomy free from coercion.

    d. The Joint Force has reinforced enduring advantages—logistics endurance, decision advantage, secure and resilient C2, and coalition integration—such that adversary attempts to create satellite coverage gaps, disrupt sustainment, or fracture alliances do not yield strategic gains.

    e. Should deterrence fail, the Joint Force is postured—through integrated deterrence and campaigning—to transition rapidly to unified action that restores the status quo ante consistent with U.S. objectives and international obligations, while maintaining strategic discipline and alliance cohesion.
