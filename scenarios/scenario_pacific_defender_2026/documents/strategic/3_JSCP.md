MEMORANDUM FOR: COMMANDER, UNITED STATES INDO-PACIFIC COMMAND

FROM: CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF

SUBJECT: Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan (JSCP) — INDOPACOM Western Pacific Multi-Domain Joint Integration and Resilience (MDJIR) Tasking (1–15 March 2026)

DATE: 01 MAR 2026

CLASSIFICATION: UNCLASSIFIED // FOUO


1. PURPOSE.

    a. This Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan (JSCP) tasking memorandum provides directed planning guidance, force apportionment priorities, and executable planning requirements to Commander, U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (CDRUSINDOPACOM) for the period 010000Z MAR 2026 through 152359Z MAR 2026, in support of a multi-domain joint operation integration exercise emphasizing air/maritime/space integration under contested logistics and intermittent satellite coverage.

    b. This JSCP is explicitly derived from and implements the parent authority: “National Military Strategy (NMS) Theater Annex — Western Pacific (INDOPACOM) Multi-Domain Joint Integration and Resilience (Effective 1–15 March 2026),” dated 01 MAR 2026 (hereafter “NMS Theater Annex”). Where this JSCP provides additional detail, it remains consistent with the NMS Theater Annex and controlling joint doctrine, including JP 5-0 (Joint Planning), JP 3-0 (Joint Operations), JP 1 (Doctrine for the Armed Forces of the United States), JP 3-30 (Joint Air Operations), JP 3-52 (Joint Airspace Control), JP 4-0 (Joint Logistics), JP 6-0 (Joint Communications System), JP 3-12 (Cyberspace Operations), and CJCSI 3100.01 (Joint Strategic Planning System). Capability gap reporting and recommendations will align with CJCSI 3170.01 (Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System) and applicable Joint Lessons Learned processes.

    c. This tasking directs theater-strategic planning and coordination requirements and apportions forces and capabilities for planning and exercise execution. It does not prescribe tactical execution, rules of engagement, or target lists.

    d. Desired outcome: produce CJCS- and Secretary of Defense-relevant readiness evidence and planning products demonstrating USINDOPACOM’s ability to DENY adversary objectives, PROTECT decision advantage, DEGRADE adversary enabling functions, SUSTAIN contested logistics, and DESTROY adversary confidence in strategic surprise and escalation control, as required by the NMS Theater Annex.


2. STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENT.

    a. Parent authority reference. The NMS Theater Annex (01 MAR 2026) assesses a near-peer Pacific state adversary employing A2/AD, long-range precision fires, counterspace actions, cyber operations, and information operations to disrupt U.S./combined C2, logistics, and coalition cohesion. The Annex directs validation of joint integration with realistic degradations, including scheduled satellite coverage gaps and contested electromagnetic spectrum conditions.

    b. Operational problem framing for this JSCP. For the Western Pacific, the joint force must demonstrate the ability to maintain mission command, generate and employ distributed combat power, and sustain operational endurance when: (1) SATCOM/ISR/PNT are intermittent; (2) logistics data systems are degraded or manipulated; (3) ports/airfields and distribution nodes are threatened; and (4) coalition interoperability must function with releasability constraints and limited bandwidth. Consistent with JP 3-0, forces must be prepared to “fight for information,” operate through disruption, and transition rapidly between competition activities and crisis response without losing escalation discipline.

    c. Assumptions and constraints for planning (exercise-realistic). Planners will assume: (1) intermittent space support with defined coverage gaps (hours-to-days); (2) cyber incidents affecting non-classified logistics networks and select mission enclaves; (3) contested spectrum with periodic jamming/spoofing injects impacting tactical data links and navigation; (4) movement restrictions and delayed clearances to simulate political and infrastructure friction; and (5) adversary ISR replication sufficient to impose signature management requirements. Constraints: execute within existing treaties, SOFAs, access agreements, and national caveats; preserve calibrated signaling; and coordinate public messaging via established interagency and combined channels.


3. STRATEGIC PRIORITIES (TASKS, EFFECTS, AND DOCTRINAL JUSTIFICATION).

    CDRUSINDOPACOM will execute the following theater-strategic priorities, each tied to effects articulated in the NMS Theater Annex. For each priority, USINDOPACOM will translate the effect into CCDR tasks (JP 5-0: objectives, tasks, and required effects) and provide assessment measures and lessons learned.

    3.1. Priority 1 — DENY adversary attainment of rapid fait accompli and short-warning escalation.

        a. Required effect (DENY). Deny adversary confidence that it can achieve operational decision prior to U.S./combined response by neutralizing a small number of bases, ports, or key communications nodes, consistent with the NMS Theater Annex, para 3.1.

        b. CCDR tasks (USINDOPACOM).
            (1) Establish and exercise a theater denial posture plan integrating PACFLT, PACAF, MARFORPAC, USARPAC, SOCPAC, and USSPACECOM supporting elements, emphasizing distributed basing and maritime maneuver.
            (2) Validate Joint Force entry and rapid reinforcement procedures under constrained RSOI, including austere/divert operations and contested air/maritime corridors; include at least one theater-wide reposition event that forces cross-component deconfliction.
            (3) Exercise integrated air and missile defense (IAMD) readiness coordination with allies/partners (as applicable) and demonstrate continuity of airspace control procedures under degraded networks, consistent with JP 3-52.
            (4) Demonstrate distributed maritime operations, including convoy/escort planning for high-value logistics movements and at-sea sustainment protection measures.
            (5) Produce a theater denial readiness assessment brief to CJCS NLT 151800Z MAR 2026 summarizing denial posture effectiveness, friction points (access, clearances, throughput), and recommended improvements.

        c. Force allocation and apportionment guidance (planning and execution priorities).
            (1) Apportion for planning: 1 Carrier Strike Group (CSG) and 1 Expeditionary Strike Group (ESG) available within theater or able to surge within 10 days; 8–10 fighter squadrons (mix of 4th/5th gen); 1–2 bomber tasking packages (BTF-style); and enabling ISR/EW, tanker, and airlift support as specified in para 3.6.
            (2) Prioritize survivability and dispersal: PACAF will plan for Agile Combat Employment (ACE) using multiple operating locations, including at least two austere/divert locations with reduced comms support.
            (3) Prioritize undersea and maritime domain awareness to complicate adversary targeting and reinforce denial.

        d. Justification (doctrine). JP 3-0 emphasizes denial through credible, distributed capability and posture that prevent adversary objectives at acceptable cost/time. JP 3-30 and JP 3-52 require integrated air operations and airspace control that persist under contested conditions; JP 5-0 directs translation of strategic effects into executable tasks and assessments.

    3.2. Priority 2 — PROTECT decision advantage, mission command, and coalition cohesion under cyber/EMS/counterspace attack.

        a. Required effect (PROTECT). Protect continuity of mission command and shared operational understanding during intermittent SATCOM/ISR/PNT and cyber/logistics disruptions, consistent with the NMS Theater Annex, para 3.2.

        b. CCDR tasks (USINDOPACOM).
            (1) Establish, exercise, and assess a distributed C2 construct (to include alternate/auxiliary C2 nodes) with clearly defined supported/supporting relationships and triggers for transition (e.g., primary JOC degradation, loss of SATCOM beyond pre-set thresholds).
            (2) Implement preplanned communications windows, mission-essential data prioritization, and manual/low-bandwidth reporting procedures across components; rehearse at least two deliberate “C2 failover” events during the exercise.
            (3) Activate and employ a theater LNO architecture (U.S. inter-component and combined) to reduce dependence on continuous digital connectivity; require each component to identify minimum essential coordination requirements deliverable by LNO/hard copy/voice-only.
            (4) Coordinate with USCYBERCOM (supported/supporting as appropriate) and Service cyber components to execute defensive cyber operations and incident response playbooks protecting mission networks and logistics systems; include at least one data integrity incident inject affecting movement/force tracking.
            (5) Coordinate with USSPACECOM to operationalize “degraded space support” battle drills, including alternate PNT procedures and protected SATCOM prioritization; validate PNT-denied navigation procedures for select air and maritime events.

        c. Coordination requirements (interagency and combined).
            (1) Establish a combined information-sharing plan addressing releasability constraints and intermittent connectivity; use existing agreements and combined mechanisms; ensure coalition partners can operate with partial data feeds.
            (2) Synchronize strategic communications themes and deconfliction pathways with appropriate interagency channels and allied counterparts to preserve escalation discipline (consistent with NMS Theater Annex, para 3.5).

        d. Justification (doctrine). JP 6-0 requires resilient and redundant communications for mission command; JP 3-12 and JP 3-0 emphasize defensive cyberspace operations and the need to fight for information advantage; JP 1 underscores unity of effort with multinational partners as a center of gravity.

    3.3. Priority 3 — DEGRADE adversary enabling functions (sensing, targeting, coordination, sustainment) through joint/combined operational patterns.

        a. Required effect (DEGRADE). Degrade adversary F2T2EA quality and kill chain integration by reducing targeting confidence, disrupting coordination, and imposing operational uncertainty, consistent with the NMS Theater Annex, para 3.3.

        b. CCDR tasks (USINDOPACOM).
            (1) Direct components to implement signature management, emissions control (EMCON), deception, and maneuver plans that measurably reduce adversary ISR replication effectiveness (exercise red-cell) against friendly critical assets.
            (2) Exercise joint ISR synchronization that accounts for intermittent space-based ISR; integrate commercial and allied-derived data where authorized and reliable; develop an ISR triage plan prioritizing time-sensitive requirements during coverage gaps.
            (3) Validate dynamic targeting processes and “degraded sensor” strike planning across air and maritime components consistent with JP 3-30, emphasizing the ability to shift between deliberate and dynamic cycles when data feeds are delayed.
            (4) Exercise counter-reconnaissance and maritime domain awareness operations that complicate adversary tracking of logistics movements and distributed basing operations.
            (5) Produce a DEGRADE effects assessment methodology (observable indicators and measures of performance/effect) suitable for reuse in future INDOPACOM exercises and contingency planning.

        c. Justification (doctrine). JP 3-0 and JP 3-30 emphasize integrated operations that create multiple dilemmas and reduce adversary effectiveness without requiring continuous dominance in one domain. JP 5-0 requires assessment plans tied to objectives and effects, including indicators suitable for commander decision-making.

    3.4. Priority 4 — SUSTAIN forward operational endurance under contested logistics and intermittent space support.

        a. Required effect (SUSTAIN). Sustain operational reach, endurance, and reconstitution despite disrupted throughput, degraded asset visibility, and threats to ports/airfields, consistent with the NMS Theater Annex, para 3.4.

        b. CCDR tasks (USINDOPACOM).
            (1) Execute a theater distribution resilience plan that reduces reliance on single hubs; demonstrate distributed stocks (fuel, critical munitions, spares) across multiple locations and afloat where feasible.
            (2) In coordination with USTRANSCOM and DLA, rehearse contested mobility: alternate routing, degraded in-transit visibility procedures, convoy/escort coordination for high-value movements, and rapid reroute decision-making during simulated threat to chokepoints.
            (3) Validate expeditionary logistics capabilities: austere airfield operations, rapid runway repair planning integration, expeditionary refueling points, and limited-communications requisition procedures.
            (4) Establish manual/alternate processes for requisition, asset visibility, and movement control when enterprise systems are degraded; include a forced transition to manual tracking for at least 24 hours during the period.
            (5) Validate medical and personnel sustainment under contested routes: casualty evacuation coordination, patient movement under communications constraints, and personnel replacement planning.

        c. Force protection integration for sustainment nodes.
            (1) Incorporate protection of critical sustainment nodes into IAMD and base defense planning to the maximum extent feasible; prioritize defense of fuel distribution, munitions handling, key C2 nodes supporting movement control, and expeditionary operating locations.

        d. Justification (doctrine). JP 4-0 emphasizes sustainment as decisive for operational reach and endurance and requires adaptability and protection of sustainment networks in contested environments. JP 3-0 notes that logistics under attack is a central feature of modern joint operations and must be trained and assessed realistically.

    3.5. Priority 5 — DESTROY adversary confidence in strategic surprise and escalation control through demonstrated readiness, resilience, and disciplined signaling.

        a. Required effect (DESTROY). Destroy adversary confidence that it can initiate aggression below the threshold of unified response, paralyze operations via limited attacks on enablers, or fracture alliances through disinformation and selective strikes, consistent with the NMS Theater Annex, para 3.5.

        b. CCDR tasks (USINDOPACOM).
            (1) Conduct visible but controlled readiness events demonstrating rapid C2 transition, distributed posture shifts, and reconstitution of degraded capabilities (e.g., restoration of airfield operations or comms reroute) without creating escalatory signaling.
            (2) Synchronize combined participation to emphasize alliance cohesion and operational competence; document and mitigate interoperability friction (releasability, comm pathways, logistics authorities).
            (3) Demonstrate continuity of operations during imposed satellite gaps and cyber/EMS disruption while maintaining safe operations and disciplined EMCON/OPSEC.
            (4) Provide CJCS a post-exercise deterrence and signaling assessment: what actions most effectively conveyed readiness and resilience, and what actions created risk of misinterpretation.

        c. Justification (doctrine). JP 3-0 describes deterrence as a function of credible capability, readiness, and perceived will; JP 1 emphasizes unified action and the strategic importance of alliances; JP 5-0 requires that operational design consider risk, signaling, and strategic communication implications.


    3.6. Force sizing and planning apportionment (baseline for 1–15 March 2026).

        a. This apportionment is for planning and exercise execution; availability is subject to SecDef orders, global force management, and emergent contingency demands. USINDOPACOM will prioritize employment concepts that remain effective if actual forces are reduced (graceful degradation).

        b. FORCE SIZING TABLE (planning baseline).
          * Required fighter squadrons: 10 (minimum 8 mission-capable for sustained operations under dispersion)
          * Required bomber taskings: 2 (BTF-style packages; at least one long-range maritime strike/anti-surface training event and one theater-wide dynamic retask event)
          * Required CSG/ESG: 2 total (1 CSG + 1 ESG; minimum 1 major naval task group continuously available)
          * Required ISR/EW support: 6 (2 maritime ISR sorties/day equivalent, 2 high-demand air ISR lines, 2 EW/EA-capable airborne or stand-in support taskings; augmented by national/commercial where authorized)
          * Required tanker orbits: 6 (4 steady-state distributed orbits + 2 surge/contingency orbits to support dispersal and reroute)

        c. Additional enabling guidance.
            (1) Airlift/sealift: USTRANSCOM coordination required for at least one large movement event and one reroute/port diversion drill; include degraded in-transit visibility injects.
            (2) Space support: coordinate prioritized protected SATCOM and missile warning support requests through USSPACECOM; plan for intermittent coverage as a primary condition, not an exception.
            (3) Cyber support: coordinate defensive cyber mission assurance activities with USCYBERCOM and Service cyber components; prioritize protection of movement control, fuel accountability, and munitions tracking systems.

        d. Force employment priorities under constraint.
            (1) If fighter capacity is constrained, prioritize counter-air, maritime strike support, and defense of distributed operating locations over non-essential presence sorties.
            (2) If naval forces are constrained, prioritize SLOC defense planning, undersea advantage preservation, and protection of logistics movements.
            (3) If tanker capacity is constrained, prioritize dispersal sustainment, medical evacuation contingencies, and critical long-range strike support.


4. COMMANDER’S INTENT (EXERCISE AND PLANNING INTENT; DERIVED FROM PARENT GUIDANCE).

    a. Purpose (derived). Consistent with the NMS Theater Annex, the purpose of USINDOPACOM actions from 1–15 March 2026 is to strengthen integrated deterrence by demonstrating the Joint Force’s ability—together with allies and partners—to DENY aggression, PROTECT decision advantage and mission command, DEGRADE adversary enabling functions through operational patterns and resilience, SUSTAIN forward endurance under contested logistics and intermittent space support, and DESTROY adversary confidence in strategic surprise and escalation control.

    b. Method.
        (1) Execute a multi-domain integration exercise employing distributed C2, ACE and distributed maritime operations, and contested logistics play that forces decisions under uncertainty.
        (2) Plan for and deliberately impose degradations (space, cyber, EMS, logistics systems) with rehearsed failover and manual procedures; measure performance and decision quality.
        (3) Integrate combined and interagency coordination through LNO networks, releasability-aware information sharing, and synchronized messaging.

    c. Key tasks (commander-level).
        (1) Maintain mission command and operationally relevant decision cycles for multiple days under intermittent SATCOM and ISR, validating preplanned comm windows and alternate C2 nodes.
        (2) Demonstrate the ability to shift and sustain combat power across distributed nodes while protecting key logistics and C2 enablers.
        (3) Produce CJCS-ready findings: priority capability gaps, policy/process constraints, and recommended DOTMLPF-P actions consistent with CJCSI 3170.01.

    d. Planning products required (deliverables).
        (1) OPLAN/CONPLAN development and refinement (JP 5-0 compliant):
            (a) CONPLAN (Level 2–3 detail) — “Western Pacific Contested Logistics Continuity”: theater distribution resilience, manual asset visibility, alternate routing, convoy/escort planning, and reconstitution triggers.
            (b) CONPLAN (Level 2–3 detail) — “Degraded Space Operations (DSO) Fight-Through”: comm/PNT/ISR degradation playbooks, comm windows, data prioritization, and operational risk controls.
            (c) CONPLAN (Level 2–3 detail) — “Distributed C2 Transition and Continuity”: supported/supporting relationships, C2 node transition triggers, minimum essential data sets, and LNO architecture.
            (d) OPLAN fragment update (as applicable to existing approved theater plans) — annex addendum capturing MDJIR exercise lessons learned and incorporating validated TTP for degraded operations.
        (2) Assessment plan: USINDOPACOM will develop an assessment framework with measures of performance/effect tied to the five effects (DENY/PROTECT/DEGRADE/SUSTAIN/DESTROY) and submit to CJCS J-7 NLT 101800Z MAR 2026 for alignment with joint lessons learned collection.
        (3) After Action Report (AAR): provide CJCS an executive summary NLT 201800Z MAR 2026 and a detailed staff AAR NLT 291800Z MAR 2026 including: capability gaps, interoperability issues, logistics bottlenecks, comm resilience outcomes, and recommended investments/priorities.

    e. Coordination requirements with adjacent CCDRs and supporting commands.
        (1) U.S. Northern Command (as required) for homeland defense implications of cyber incidents affecting logistics networks (informational coordination).
        (2) U.S. European Command (USEUCOM): coordinate for competing global force demands and to deconflict strategic lift and bomber tasking schedules; establish a liaison arrangement to manage cross-theater air refueling and ISR allocation friction.
        (3) U.S. Central Command (USCENTCOM): coordinate to deconflict tanker and ISR apportionment, ensure continuity of high-demand/low-density assets, and establish procedures for rapid reallocation if emergent CENTCOM requirements arise.
        (4) USTRANSCOM: coordinate contested mobility injects, alternate routing, port diversion drills, and in-transit visibility degradation play; ensure command relationships and authorities are clearly documented.
        (5) USSPACECOM and USCYBERCOM: coordinate support plans and battle drills; ensure authorities and reporting thresholds are understood and exercised without delay.

    f. Risk guidance (derived).
        (1) Overreliance on space-enabled services and enterprise networks is a primary operational risk; mitigation requires enforcing degradations, rehearsing manual processes, and prioritizing mission-essential information.
        (2) Strategic misinterpretation risk requires calibrated visibility, transparent ally coordination, and disciplined messaging; avoid actions that could be construed as preparations for imminent offensive operations beyond exercise scope.
        (3) Coalition friction risk requires LNO architecture, pre-coordinated releasability, and procedures that work with intermittent connectivity.


5. ENDSTATE.

    a. Denial posture and readiness demonstrably improved. The Joint Force and combined partners demonstrate credible, distributed denial capabilities in the Western Pacific, including the ability to disperse, defend, and continue operations when primary nodes are threatened or degraded, consistent with the NMS Theater Annex endstate.

    b. Decision advantage preserved under degradation. USINDOPACOM demonstrates mission command continuity for days under intermittent satellite coverage, contested EMS, and cyber/logistics disruptions, with functioning alternate C2 nodes, comm windows, and manual procedures that preserve decision quality.

    c. Adversary enabling functions practically degraded (validated by exercise replication). Friendly operational patterns, signature management, and multi-domain coordination reduce adversary ISR/targeting confidence in the exercise construct and provide reusable methods for future contingency application.

    d. Forward endurance validated under contested logistics. Theater sustainment and mobility concepts demonstrate distributed stocks, alternate routing, protection of high-value logistics movements, and reconstitution capabilities; manual asset visibility procedures function sufficiently to sustain operations when enterprise systems are degraded.

    e. Alliance cohesion and access strengthened. Combined interoperability improves through rehearsed access, basing, overflight/port clearance processes, and releasability-aware information sharing; coalition messaging and coordination remain coherent during disruption.

    f. CJCS-ready capability and planning feedback produced. USINDOPACOM delivers prioritized observations and recommendations aligned to CJCSI 3170.01, highlighting gaps and investment priorities in resilient C2, contested logistics, space support alternatives, EMS maneuver, and combined interoperability for the Western Pacific operating environment.
