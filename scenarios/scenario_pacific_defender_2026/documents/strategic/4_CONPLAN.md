2. PURPOSE.

    This CONPLAN translates CJCS JSCP MDJIR tasking into an executable theater operational concept for a multi-domain joint integration exercise emphasizing air/maritime/space integration under contested logistics and intermittent satellite coverage gaps (010000Z MAR 2026 through 152359Z MAR 2026). This CONPLAN provides the operational framework that will drive ORBAT refinement, daily ATO/ACO development, joint movement and distribution scheduling, and assessment/lessons learned in accordance with JP 5-0 and JP 3-0.


3. SITUATION.

    a. Adversary (Near-peer Pacific state adversary) — capabilities and intent (exercise-realistic).

        (1) Strategic intent (as replicated for MDJIR). Adversary seeks to achieve a rapid operational fait accompli within the First Island Chain by leveraging short-warning escalation, A2/AD, and information/cyber/counterspace operations to delay or fragment U.S./combined response, while shaping political decision-making through calibrated coercion and ambiguity.

        (2) A2/AD and long-range fires. Adversary fields a layered strike complex (land-based anti-ship and land-attack missiles; air- and maritime-launched cruise missiles; long-range rocket artillery in proximate areas; and integrated fires supported by ISR). Adversary targeting emphasizes fixed and semi-fixed nodes: major ports, primary airfields, POL storage, and visible C2 emitters. Adversary employs salvo tactics intended to overwhelm point defenses and complicate base recovery operations.

        (3) Maritime and undersea. Adversary uses surface action groups, submarines, maritime patrol aircraft, and unmanned maritime systems to contest sea lines of communication (SLOCs), threaten high-value logistics shipping, and impose risk on replenishment at sea. Adversary will prioritize locating and tracking U.S. carrier/amphibious groups while forcing dispersal and defensive postures.

        (4) Air and IADS. Adversary employs modern fighter aircraft, long-range air-to-air missiles, and an integrated air defense system (IADS) with overlapping sensors and SAM coverage. The IADS is designed to stress tanker support, reduce time-on-station, and force the joint force to operate from extended ranges and distributed locations. Adversary uses electronic attack to degrade data links and disrupt airspace coordination.

        (5) Cyber and information. Adversary conducts cyber operations to disrupt non-classified logistics networks, manipulate movement/force tracking data, and create uncertainty in sustainment and force posture. Adversary information operations attempt to fracture coalition cohesion and exploit the friction of movement restrictions and access delays.

        (6) Space and electromagnetic spectrum (EMS). Adversary conducts counterspace activities (reversible effects, dazzling, interference) and GPS spoofing/jamming to degrade PNT and ISR. Adversary targets SATCOM links and exploits predictable network behaviors. MDJIR will replicate intermittent satellite coverage gaps (hours-to-days) and periodic data-link interference events.

        (7) Most likely adversary approach during MDJIR. Demonstrate “detect-decide-strike-assess” kill chain attempts against joint force C2 and logistics nodes, combined with EMS/cyber disruptions designed to force manual processes and degrade tempo.

        (8) Adversary constraints (exercise). Actions remain bounded to simulated effects; no real-world ROE changes are implied. No target lists or lethal effects are required for MDJIR; replication focuses on decision-making, resilience, and continuity of operations.

    b. Friendly forces and support relationships (notional allocation consistent with JSCP apportionment).

        (1) Supported commander. CDRUSINDOPACOM is the supported commander for theater MDJIR execution.

        (2) Key supporting commanders/components and typical responsibilities (JP 3-0; JP 5-0).
            (a) PACFLT: maritime maneuver, sea control/sea denial, convoy/escort planning, maritime strike integration, undersea coordination, and at-sea sustainment protection.
            (b) PACAF: joint air operations (with JFACC construct as designated), Agile Combat Employment (ACE), air mobility coordination, tanker management, and airbase resiliency playbooks.
            (c) MARFORPAC: littoral operations, expeditionary advanced base operations (EABO) experimentation, air defense and fires integration (exercise), and expeditionary logistics nodes (ELNs).
            (d) USARPAC: theater sustainment posture, air and missile defense coordination (exercise), multi-domain effects coordination cells, and land-based distribution nodes.
            (e) SOCPAC: liaison architecture, low-signature reconnaissance/sensing concepts (exercise), and crisis response planning integration.
            (f) USSPACECOM (supporting): degraded space support battle drills, protected SATCOM prioritization, alternate PNT procedures, and space ISR coordination within exercise constraints.
            (g) USCYBERCOM/Service cyber components (supporting): defensive cyber operations (DCO), incident response, and data integrity remediation for logistics and mission networks.

        (3) Combined/allied/partner participation (exercise planning). Participation and access are bounded by standing agreements and national caveats. The CONPLAN assumes a combined coordination layer enabling: (a) shared airspace control measures where authorized; (b) information-sharing with releasability constraints; (c) limited bandwidth and intermittent connectivity; and (d) partner operations with partial data feeds.

    c. Theater geography and operating environment.

        (1) Operating area. Western Pacific theater with focus on the First and Second Island Chains, key maritime chokepoints, and distributed basing network across allied and U.S. territories. Operations will be executed with an assumption of adversary ISR replication sufficient to impose signature management requirements.

        (2) Physical factors. Long distances, limited hardened infrastructure at austere locations, finite ramp space and fuel capacity, and weather impacts (seasonal turbulence, maritime state). These factors will be used to stress distribution and sortie generation.

        (3) Information environment. Intermittent SATCOM coverage, periodic PNT degradation, contested EMS, and degraded logistics data systems are assumed. The operational design must “fight for information” (JP 3-0) and preserve mission command continuity through redundancy and disciplined communications (JP 6-0).


4. MISSION STATEMENT.

    USINDOPACOM conducts MDJIR (1–15 March 2026) in the Western Pacific to demonstrate and assess multi-domain joint force integration and resilience by (1) denying adversary confidence in achieving a rapid fait accompli through distributed posture and integrated air/maritime maneuver; (2) protecting decision advantage and coalition cohesion through resilient C2 under cyber/EMS/counterspace disruption; and (3) sustaining contested logistics and distributed operations despite intermittent satellite coverage gaps and degraded data systems, in order to provide CJCS/OSD readiness evidence, validated battle drills, and capability gap recommendations in accordance with JP 5-0, JP 3-0, JP 3-52, and CJCSI 3170.01.


5. CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS.

    a. Commander’s intent.

        (1) Purpose. Validate that the joint force can maintain mission command, generate combat power from distributed locations, and sustain operational endurance when space and cyberspace support are degraded and logistics nodes are threatened.

        (2) Method. Employ a theater-wide distributed C2 construct with deliberate failovers; integrate PACFLT maritime maneuver with PACAF ACE; conduct convoy/escort planning and at-sea sustainment protection; execute airspace control continuity drills under degraded networks; and stress the distribution system with access delays and data integrity injects.

        (3) End state. Joint force demonstrates credible denial posture; C2 remains continuous despite intermittent SATCOM/ISR/PNT; logistics sustains distributed operations with measured throughput and recovery timelines; coalition coordination functions with partial data; and USINDOPACOM delivers a readiness assessment and capability gap recommendations to CJCS NLT 151800Z MAR 2026.

            (2) Core activities: distributed C2 nodes; comm windows and mission-essential data prioritization; LNO architecture; procedural airspace control; cross-domain information sharing with releasability controls.

        LOO 3 — Contested Logistics and Endurance (Distribution/Sustainment/Base Recovery).
            (1) Purpose: Sustain operational tempo when logistics data systems are degraded/manipulated and nodes are threatened.
            (2) Core activities: alternate distribution pathways; convoy/escort planning; at-sea replenishment protection; forward arming and refueling concept validation (where authorized); manual LCOP backup; rapid reconstitution drills.

        LOO 4 — Information Advantage Under Degradation (Cyber/Space/EMS Integration).
            (1) Purpose: Fight for information and maintain acceptable targeting/collection fidelity using degraded space support and contested EMS.
            (2) Core activities: alternate PNT and navigation procedures; protected SATCOM prioritization; DCO/incident response; spectrum management; collection synchronization using low-bandwidth methods.

    d. Decisive Points (DPs) for MDJIR assessment.

        DP1 — Distributed C2 Effective Transition.
            Condition: Successful transition to alternate/auxiliary C2 node within established time threshold while maintaining ATO/ACO continuity and command authorities (JP 6-0). Measure: time to re-establish minimum essential C2 services; number of missed/late critical reports; operational impacts.

        DP2 — ACE Sustainment at Austere Locations.
            Condition: Sustained generation of sorties from dispersed/austere locations with reduced comms and constrained fuel/munitions handling. Measure: sortie generation rate vs plan; refuel/rearm cycle times; maintenance recovery; safety deviations.

        DP3 — Contested Distribution Reroute and Recovery.
            Condition: Logistics flow maintained after simulated denial of a primary port/airfield/distribution node and compromise of logistics tracking data. Measure: time to reroute; throughput achieved; inventory accuracy after reconciliation; impact on operational tempo.

        DP4 — Airspace Control Continuity Under Degraded Networks.
            Condition: Airspace deconfliction maintained during datalink disruptions and intermittent SATCOM via procedural measures and preplanned airspace control measures (JP 3-52). Measure: number of deconfliction incidents; timeliness of ACO updates; controller workload and clarity.

        DP5 — Convoy/Escort and At-Sea Sustainment Protection (Procedural).
            Condition: High-value logistics movement planned and executed (exercise) with layered defense and dynamic rerouting under ISR threat replication. Measure: adherence to escort plan; responsiveness to reroute triggers; communications discipline; risk acceptance documentation.

    e. Scheme of maneuver (exercise-level; no target lists; procedural focus).

        (1) Joint Force posture and maneuver.
            (a) Maritime. PACFLT will operate a notional CSG and ESG in dispersed operating areas to validate maritime maneuver, escort concepts, and sea-based sustainment protection. Undersea coordination will emphasize maritime domain awareness and deconfliction with logistics shipping routes.
            (b) Air. PACAF will execute ACE with multiple operating locations to complicate adversary targeting and to validate command relationships and sustainment. A bomber tasking package (BTF-style) will be integrated procedurally to stress tanker planning, airspace control measures, and comm windows.
            (c) Land and littoral. USARPAC and MARFORPAC will support establishment and sustainment of expeditionary logistics nodes and limited, exercise-focused EABO constructs, primarily to stress distribution, communications, and protection coordination.
            (d) Space/cyber/EMS. USSPACECOM support will implement scheduled coverage gaps and PNT degradation injects; USCYBERCOM/Service cyber will run defensive playbooks and incident response to logistics data manipulation scenarios.

        (2) Fires and effects integration (exercise). MDJIR will validate joint processes for integrating effects (air/maritime/cyber/space) at a procedural level: collection management, target development decision points (without target lists), and battle damage/assessment reporting under intermittent connectivity.

        (3) Protection. IAMD coordination will be exercised as a readiness and procedural drill, integrating reporting, warning, and deconfliction measures with allies where authorized. Base/port recovery is simulated to validate decision timing and resource prioritization.

        (4) Information sharing and coalition operations. Combined operations will emphasize: minimal essential information exchange; alternate communications pathways; LNO-enabled coordination; and operation under partial data feeds while preserving releasability constraints.

        -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    g. Coordinating instructions (exercise execution principles).

        (1) No-strike/target lists are not produced. Effects integration is procedural and assessment-focused.

        (2) Communications discipline: implement mission-essential data elements (MEDE) and priority of communications by phase; enforce comm windows and reporting formats to reduce bandwidth requirements.

        (3) Delegated authorities: components will identify and rehearse decentralized execution authorities for time-sensitive safety and deconfliction decisions when connectivity is lost.

        (4) Assessment: each phase includes defined measures of performance (MOP) and measures of effectiveness (MOE) mapped to DPs and LOOs; components will submit daily assessment inputs during comm windows.


6. ADVERSARY COURSES OF ACTION (COAs) (exercise replication; 2–3 COAs).

    COA A — “Rapid Disruption of C2 and Logistics” (Most likely).
        (1) Adversary initiates cyber attacks against unclassified logistics networks and selectively against mission enclaves, generating data integrity issues and delayed movement clearances.
        (2) Concurrent EMS jamming/spoofing degrades data links and GPS in localized windows, timed to ATO/airspace transition periods.
        (3) Counterspace interference produces intermittent SATCOM/ISR gaps, forcing procedural control and manual reporting.
        (4) Objective: slow U.S./combined decision cycle; create perception of disorganization and sustainment fragility.

    COA B — “Maritime Interdiction and ISR Overmatch” (Most dangerous to sustainment).
        (1) Adversary prioritizes persistent ISR (air/maritime/space) and attempts to localize high-value logistics shipping and replenishment events.
        (2) Simulated submarine/surface threats force convoy/escort responses and rerouting, increasing distribution time and fuel burn.
        (3) Objective: impose operational pause by threatening SLOCs and at-sea sustainment, stressing escort availability and communications.

    COA C — “Selective Base/Node Denial and Psychological Pressure” (High political friction).
        (1) Adversary conducts simulated precision strikes against a small set of key nodes (ports/airfields/POL storage) and amplifies the effects via information operations.
        (2) Adversary pairs this with diplomatic coercion and disinformation to generate access delays and movement restrictions.
        (3) Objective: concentrate U.S. operations into fewer nodes (making them more targetable) and strain coalition cohesion.


7. FRIENDLY COURSES OF ACTION (Recommended COA).

    COA 1 — “Distributed Denial with Resilient C2 and Contested Distribution” (RECOMMENDED).

    a. Summary. Execute a theater-wide distributed posture (air and maritime), anchored by resilient mission command and a deliberate contested logistics concept, to demonstrate denial credibility and sustainment endurance under intermittent satellite coverage and degraded networks.

    b. Rationale (JP 5-0). COA 1 directly addresses JSCP priorities: deny adversary fait accompli confidence, protect decision advantage, and sustain contested logistics. It provides measurable DPs and integrates joint capabilities without requiring tactical escalation.

    c. Key elements.
        (1) Distributed C2 architecture with two deliberate failover events; LNO-driven coordination as primary backup.
        (2) ACE dispersal to forward and austere locations with preplanned sortie packages and reduced comms assumptions.
        (3) PACFLT-led convoy/escort planning and distributed maritime operations; at-sea sustainment protection drills.
        (4) Degraded space support battle drills and alternate PNT procedures across air and maritime operations.
        (5) Logistics resilience: reroute plan, manual LCOP, and data integrity incident response.

    d. Risk and mitigation (exercise).
        (1) Risk: overextension of tankers and mobility assets reduces realism or safety margins. Mitigation: enforce tanker prioritization by phase; cap sortie surges; rehearse abort/divert procedures.
        (2) Risk: coalition information-sharing constraints slow coordination. Mitigation: publish releasable MEDE sets; use LNO channels and comm windows; pre-coordinate procedural airspace measures.
        (3) Risk: excessive complexity in failover events causes loss of learning objectives. Mitigation: define minimum essential services, clear triggers, and time-bounded failover periods; focus on continuity not perfection.


8. FORCE REQUIREMENTS (General categories; refined in OPLAN and sourcing conferences).

    a. Maneuver forces.
        (1) One CSG and one ESG (or functionally equivalent naval task groups) to enable distributed maritime operations and escort drills.
        (2) 8–10 fighter squadrons (4th/5th gen mix) for ACE dispersal and airspace control stress.
        (3) 1–2 bomber tasking packages integrated procedurally to stress long-range planning, tanker coordination, and airspace measures.

    b. Enablers.
        (1) Tankers sufficient to support distributed operations, with priority to defensive counterair, maritime strike integration drills, and mobility corridors.
        (2) Strategic and theater airlift to support RSOI under friction and sustain forward/austere nodes.
        (3) ISR (air/maritime) with assumptions of partial feeds; focus on MDA and distribution protection.
        (4) EW/EMS management capabilities to operate through jamming and degraded links.

    c. Protection and resilience.
        (1) IAMD coordination elements (joint and combined) to exercise warning, reporting, and engagement coordination procedures.
        (2) Base defense and expeditionary security elements for forward/austere locations (exercise scope).
        (3) Cyber protection teams/incident response for logistics networks and mission enclaves.
        (4) Space support coordination for protected SATCOM prioritization and alternate PNT battle drills.

    d. Command and control.
        (1) JTF-capable staff augmentation for JOC, JCC, and functional cells (JFMCC/JFACC synchronization, logistics, cyber/space).
        (2) LNO teams: component-to-component, combined LNOs where permitted, and logistics LNOs to key nodes.
        (3) Deployable/transportable comm packages to support alternate/auxiliary C2 nodes and austere locations.

    e. Capability gaps and JCIDS linkage (CJCSI 3170.01).
        (1) Components will document: (a) communications shortfalls; (b) logistics data integrity vulnerabilities; (c) PNT-denied procedure gaps; (d) tanker/mobility limitations; and (e) coalition interoperability constraints, with recommended DOTMLPF-P actions for follow-on validation.


9. LOGISTICS CONCEPT (JP 4-0; contested distribution emphasis).

    a. Logistics intent. Sustain distributed operations for 15 days under contested logistics conditions by using multiple distribution pathways, prioritizing critical commodities, and maintaining an auditable manual fallback when logistics IT and satellite connectivity are degraded.

    b. Distribution framework.

        (1) Multi-node network. Use a tiered distribution concept:
            (a) Strategic entry nodes (limited number; higher throughput; higher risk).
            (b) Theater distribution hubs (multiple; shiftable based on threat and access).
            (c) Expeditionary logistics nodes (ELNs) supporting ACE forward/austere operations with prepositioned kits and constrained stockage.
        (2) Dynamic routing. Establish triggers for rerouting (node closure, threat replication, data integrity concern, clearance delay) and pre-identified alternates for air and sea movement.
        (3) Convoy/escort procedures. PACFLT leads planning for high-value sealift movements and at-sea replenishment protection (exercise), integrating comm windows and reporting discipline to reduce ISR exposure.

    c. Supply priorities (planning guidance).

        (1) Priority 1: aviation fuel, tanker support sustainment, and POL distribution continuity (aviation and maritime).
        (2) Priority 2: critical munitions handling (exercise representation), spare parts with high mission impact, and runway/airfield repair consumables (simulated).
        (3) Priority 3: food/water/medical sustainment for forward/austere detachments.
        (4) Priority 4: construction/barrier materials supporting expeditionary resilience.

    d. Maintenance and reconstitution.

        (1) Forward maintenance. PACAF and MARFORPAC will validate forward maintenance and cannibalization controls (exercise) under data system degradation.
        (2) Reconstitution drills. Simulate base recovery after replicated strikes: runway closure timelines, ramp clearance, fuel system checks, and sortie re-generation decisions.
        (3) Maritime sustainment. Validate replenishment planning, consumption reporting via comm windows, and risk-informed scheduling.

    e. Data integrity and manual LCOP fallback.

        (1) Assumption: logistics tracking data will be manipulated or partially unavailable.
        (2) Required battle drill: reconcile shipments and inventories using (a) manual logs; (b) LNO confirmation; (c) periodic “truth” checks during comm windows; and (d) cross-validation from mobility departure/arrival records.
        (3) Reporting: daily logistics posture report in MEDE format (fuel, critical parts, throughput constraints, node status, distribution delays) with time-stamped confidence level (high/medium/low).

    f. Measures (logistics MOP/MOE examples).
        (1) Time to reroute after node denial; throughput maintained as percent of plan.
        (2) Fuel days-of-supply at forward/austere nodes; number of sorties impacted by POL shortfalls.
        (3) Inventory record accuracy after incident inject; time to restore trusted data set.
        (4) Sealift/airlift schedule adherence under clearance delays; variance and cause coding.

    g. Environmental and safety constraints. All logistics operations will comply with host-nation regulations, SOFA constraints, safety requirements, and hazardous material handling standards. The exercise will not compel unsafe operations to meet scenario objectives.


10. COMMAND AND CONTROL (JP 3-0; JP 6-0; JP 3-52).

    a. Command relationships (exercise).

        (1) CDRUSINDOPACOM retains combatant command authority (COCOM) as applicable and exercises operational control through designated functional/component commanders in accordance with standing command relationships.

        (2) Functional coordination. The JOC will synchronize JFMCC/JFACC operations, logistics, cyber, and space support via the MDJIR Joint Coordination Cell (JCC). Components will maintain organic command while adhering to theater comm windows and reporting standards.

        (3) Supported/supporting transitions. Triggers for supported/supporting shifts (e.g., primary focus on logistics protection vs airspace control continuity) will be pre-briefed in Phase 0 and rehearsed during failover events.

    b. Distributed C2 construct.

        (1) Primary. Theater JOC with integrated planning and current operations, including a resilient communications plan with prioritized services.

        (2) Alternate and auxiliary. Establish designated alternate/auxiliary C2 nodes with minimum essential services, able to assume time-bounded lead for execution if primary services degrade beyond thresholds.

        (3) Failover triggers (examples; finalize in execution order).
            (a) Loss of SATCOM beyond a defined duration affecting ATO/ACO transmission.
            (b) Cyber incident causing loss of integrity in COP/LCOP.
            (c) Facility/service outage impacting ability to produce or disseminate time-sensitive guidance.
        (4) Failover success criteria. Restoration of: (a) voice command net; (b) airspace control measures dissemination (procedural if required); (c) logistics priority guidance; and (d) consolidated assessment reporting.

    c. Communications plan (high level).

        (1) Operate with intermittent SATCOM: publish daily comm windows, prioritized by phase and mission type.

        (2) Mission-essential data elements (MEDE) prioritization (examples).
            Priority A: safety of flight/navigation advisories, airspace control measures, time-sensitive deconfliction.
            Priority B: logistics node status and movement priorities, tanker allocations, medevac coordination.
            Priority C: assessment summaries and lessons learned inputs.

        (3) Procedural control. When datalinks are degraded, airspace control will shift to preplanned procedural measures (JP 3-52), with published altitude blocks, routing structures, and timing control measures as required.

        (4) Coalition communications. Provide releasable products and MEDE sets; rely on LNOs and scheduled exchanges; avoid dependence on continuous high-bandwidth feeds.

    d. Cyber defense and incident response integration (JP 3-12).

        (1) Defensive posture. Prioritize protection of: (a) mission command networks; (b) airspace control planning systems; (c) logistics planning/tracking; and (d) identity and access management.

        (2) Incident response. Execute at least one major incident inject affecting logistics data integrity; require containment, eradication, recovery, and restoration of trusted data sets, with commander decision points on risk acceptance for continued operations.

        (3) Reporting. Cyber incidents reported via MEDE with confidence levels and operational impact statements.

    e. Space support coordination.

        (1) Degraded space battle drills. USSPACECOM supporting elements will implement scheduled gaps; components will execute alternate PNT procedures and protected SATCOM prioritization.

        (2) Navigation and timing. Validate PNT-denied navigation procedures for designated air and maritime events; report deviations and safety impacts.

    f. Assessment and lessons learned.

        (1) Assessment framework (JP 5-0). Map MOP/MOE to LOOs and DPs; collect daily during comm windows; conduct phase-end reviews.

        (2) Lessons learned and capability gaps. Document gaps with DOTMLPF-P framing and recommended next steps aligned to CJCSI 3170.01; identify which gaps require follow-on experimentation vs near-term TTP updates.

        (3) Deliverable. Theater denial posture readiness assessment and resilience summary brief to CJCS NLT 151800Z MAR 2026, including: key findings, quantified impacts, mitigations, and prioritized recommendations.
