      "content": "MEMORANDUM FOR: COMMANDER, UNITED STATES INDO-PACIFIC COMMAND\n\nFROM: SECRETARY OF DEFENSE\n\nSUBJECT: National Defense Strategy (NDS) Extract — Integrated Deterrence and Enduring Advantages in the Western Pacific (Effective 1–15 March 2026)\n\nDATE: 01 MAR 2026\n\nCLASSIFICATION: UNCLASSIFIED // FOUO\n\n\n1. PURPOSE.\n\n    a. This memorandum provides a National Defense Strategy (NDS) extract to guide U.S. INDOPACOM’s strategic framing, prioritization, and alignment of joint and combined activities in the Western Pacific during the effective period. This extract informs downstream plans and products while remaining national-level in scope and intent.\n\n    b. This NDS extract translates national defense priorities into theater-relevant strategic effects. It is intended to align Department of Defense (DoD) posture, campaigning, and readiness investments with integrated deterrence, crisis resilience, and the protection of U.S. strategic interests. It emphasizes joint force credibility under conditions of contested logistics, intermittent space support, and adversary efforts to disrupt U.S. command and control, sensing, and sustainment networks.\n\n    c. This guidance does not direct specific operations, targeting, or tactical employment. It provides strategic priorities and desired strategic effects consistent with the NDS and joint doctrine to inform planning, force development advocacy, and coordination with allies and partners.\n\n2. STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENT.\n\n    a. Parent Strategic Guidance. This extract is derived from and must be read consistent with the “2022 National Defense Strategy of the United States of America,” including its central concepts of (1) integrated deterrence, (2) campaigning, and (3) building enduring advantages. It also aligns with the Chairman’s role in translating strategy to military advice and planning through joint doctrine and guidance, including “Joint Publication (JP) 5-0, Joint Planning,” and “JP 3-0, Joint Operations.”\n\n    b. Pacing Threat. The People’s Republic of China (PRC) remains the pacing threat for the Department of Defense. The PRC’s modernization and coercive regional behavior—paired with its growing capacity to contest U.S. military advantages across air, maritime, cyber, and space domains—constitute the most consequential and systemic challenge to U.S. national security in the Western Pacific. The PRC’s strategy seeks to achieve regional hegemony, undermine allied cohesion, restrict freedom of action, and alter the status quo through intimidation, gray-zone activity, and potential rapid escalation designed to present the United States and allies with a fait accompli.\n\n    c. Acute and Persistent Threats. While the PRC is the pacing threat, other actors can create acute crises that stress U.S. capacity, readiness, and decision-making. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) retains the ability to generate rapid escalation through missile and WMD-related activities. Russia remains disruptive through opportunistic military and information activities, including strategic messaging, undersea and long-range strike developments, and arms cooperation that can indirectly affect theater risk. Violent extremist organizations and transnational criminal networks continue to exploit seams, particularly in the maritime domain, and can complicate access, basing, and partner capacity.\n\n    d. Strategic Conditions in the Western Pacific. The Western Pacific is a core geography for U.S. national defense due to: (1) treaty alliances and defense commitments; (2) globally significant sea lines of communication; (3) concentration of high-technology industrial capacity; and (4) the region’s centrality to global economic stability. The strategic environment is characterized by increasing adversary investments in anti-access/area denial (A2/AD), long-range precision fires, air and maritime integrated air defense systems, counterspace capabilities, cyber operations, and information operations intended to fracture alliances and delay U.S. mobilization and employment.\n\n    e. Contestation of Logistics and Space. The United States must assume that any major contingency in the Western Pacific will be marked by contested logistics, degraded communications, intermittent positioning/navigation/timing, and reduced space-based ISR availability—whether from adversary action, environmental factors, or congestion and disruption in the electromagnetic spectrum. Strategic resilience therefore requires designing forces, posture, and sustainment concepts that remain effective when satellite coverage is intermittent and when theater distribution networks face persistent disruption.\n\n    f. Strategic Interests. U.S. strategic interests in the Western Pacific include: deterring aggression; preserving the sovereignty and security of allies and partners; maintaining freedom of navigation and overflight consistent with international law; protecting U.S. citizens and the homeland from coercion or attack; sustaining an open, rules-based international order; ensuring the security of undersea infrastructure and critical digital connectivity; and preventing adversary control of key terrain, chokepoints, and information networks that would enable coercion at scale.\n\n    g. National Approach: Integrated Deterrence, Campaigning, Enduring Advantages. The NDS directs the Department to deter, and if necessary prevail, by integrating capabilities across domains and with allies and partners; campaigning day-to-day to shape the environment and reduce risk of conflict; and building enduring advantages in the defense industrial base, logistics resilience, munitions, training, and command and control. In INDOPACOM, these themes require credible forward posture, resilient sustainment, adaptable C2, and combined interoperability—without overreliance on a single domain, platform, or infrastructure node.\n\n3. STRATEGIC PRIORITIES.\n\n    The following strategic priorities establish national-level effects to be achieved by DoD components operating in the Western Pacific. These effects are expressed using joint doctrinal terms and are intended to guide theater campaigning, posture, security cooperation, and contingency preparedness. Commanders will ensure these priorities are reflected in plans and assessments consistent with “JP 5-0, Joint Planning,” and executed through integrated joint actions as described in “JP 3-0, Joint Operations.” The effects below should be pursued in coordination with interagency partners and in concert with allies and partners consistent with integrated deterrence.\n\n    (1) DENY adversary attainment of strategic objectives through coercion or rapid escalation in the Western Pacific.\n\n        (a) Effect. Deny the PRC the ability to achieve a fait accompli against U.S. allies and partners or to unilaterally change the status quo through coercion, gray-zone aggression, or limited use of force. Deny adversary confidence that it can control escalation, isolate allies, or delay U.S. response through attacks on C2, logistics, or space-enabled advantages.\n\n        (b) Justification (Doctrine). “JP 3-0, Joint Operations” emphasizes that deterrence and compellence rely on the credible capability and will to deny an adversary’s objectives and impose costs. “JP 5-0, Joint Planning” directs planners to translate strategic objectives into achievable military end states and to account for adversary centers of gravity, objectives, and risk. Denial in this context is a strategic effect achieved by credible posture, resilient command and control, and combined readiness that convinces the pacing threat it cannot achieve objectives at acceptable cost or within acceptable time.\n\n        (c) Strategic Emphasis. Denial requires: (i) integrated air and missile defense posture and readiness with allies; (ii) combined maritime domain awareness; (iii) credible conventional deterrent options that can function under degraded space support; and (iv) persistent campaigning that strengthens political cohesion and demonstrates the ability to fight through disruption.\n\n    (2) PROTECT U.S. and allied decision advantage, mission command, and critical defense relationships against multi-domain disruption.\n\n        (a) Effect. Protect the integrity and continuity of joint and combined command and control, including decision processes, communications pathways, and shared operational understanding, against adversary cyber, electromagnetic spectrum, information, and counterspace actions. Protect alliance cohesion and partner confidence by ensuring combined interoperability and reliable coordination mechanisms during crisis and competition.\n\n        (b) Justification (Doctrine). “JP 3-0” underscores that effective operations require information advantage and resilient C2 across the range of military operations. “JP 6-0, Joint Communications System,” and “JP 3-12, Cyberspace Operations,” highlight the need for resilient, secure, and redundant communications and cyber defense to sustain mission command. Although tactical execution is left to the combatant commander, the national strategic effect is protection of decision advantage—ensuring the Joint Force can coordinate, adapt, and act faster than the adversary under contested conditions.\n\n        (c) Strategic Emphasis. Protecting decision advantage entails emphasizing: (i) distributed and resilient C2 architectures; (ii) assured communications and navigation alternatives; (iii) counter-disinformation coordination with interagency and allies; and (iv) strengthened operational-level interoperability and information-sharing arrangements that can persist during satellite coverage gaps and communications degradation.\n\n    (3) DEGRADE adversary capacity to conduct sustained multi-domain coercion and to hold U.S. forces and partners at risk.\n\n        (a) Effect. Degrade the PRC’s ability to employ integrated multi-domain effects—particularly long-range precision strike, maritime and air denial, cyber disruption, and counterspace operations—that threaten U.S. forces, allies, and regional stability. Degrade adversary confidence in the effectiveness of its A2/AD posture by reducing its ability to generate accurate targeting, persistent ISR, and coordinated multi-domain fires.\n\n        (b) Justification (Doctrine). “JP 3-0” describes defeating adversary systems through the coordinated application of joint capabilities to create multiple dilemmas and reduce adversary effectiveness. “JP 3-30, Joint Air Operations,” and “JP 3-52, Joint Airspace Control,” provide doctrinal foundations for integrating air capabilities and airspace control to achieve strategic and operational effects, including suppression of adversary systems that enable attacks and coercion. At the national strategic level, degrading key enabling functions—sensing, targeting, coordination, and sustainment of adversary multi-domain operations—supports deterrence by complicating planning, increasing uncertainty, and lowering adversary expectations of success.\n\n        (c) Strategic Emphasis. Degradation, as a strategic objective, prioritizes: (i) partner and ally capabilities that complicate adversary targeting and operations; (ii) collective readiness to operate in a contested electromagnetic environment; and (iii) joint and combined integration that reduces single points of failure and limits adversary opportunities to exploit seams between domains or national authorities.\n\n    (4) SUSTAIN the Joint Force and allied/partner capacity to persist forward under contested logistics and intermittent space support.\n\n        (a) Effect. Sustain credible forward presence and the ability to surge and persist combat power by ensuring that logistics, basing access, mobility, and industrial support can function despite disruption. Sustain alliance operational endurance by improving combined logistics compatibility, pre-crisis coordination mechanisms, and distributed sustainment concepts that reduce vulnerability to attacks on centralized nodes.\n\n        (b) Justification (Doctrine). “JP 4-0, Joint Logistics,” stresses that operational reach and endurance are enabled by logistics and that contested environments require adaptability, distribution, and protection of sustainment networks. “JP 5-0” emphasizes identifying constraints and restraints, assessing risk, and ensuring feasibility in planning. The NDS emphasis on building enduring advantages and campaigning requires logistics resilience as a strategic advantage, not merely an enabling function.\n\n        (c) Strategic Emphasis. Sustainment at the strategic level requires: (i) resilient distribution and stockpiling concepts aligned with theater posture; (ii) munitions and critical spares readiness; (iii) agreements and processes that enable combined sustainment with allies and partners; and (iv) improved ability to operate effectively with reduced reliance on continuous satellite support.\n\n    (5) DESTROY adversary confidence in achieving strategic surprise and in controlling escalation, while preserving U.S. freedom of action and credibility.\n\n        (a) Effect. Destroy adversary confidence that it can initiate aggression without timely, coordinated U.S. and allied response; destroy the perceived benefits of limited aggression, coercive escalation, or attacks on enabling infrastructure. This effect is psychological and strategic: it is achieved by demonstrating credible, integrated capabilities; unified alliance signaling; and the capacity to reconstitute and continue operations after disruption.\n\n        (b) Justification (Doctrine). “JP 3-0” notes that deterrence is strengthened when adversaries perceive that U.S. forces can respond rapidly and effectively and can impose unacceptable costs. “JP 1, Doctrine for the Armed Forces of the United States,” emphasizes the importance of unified action with interagency and multinational partners to achieve national objectives. At the national level, destroying adversary confidence supports crisis stability and reduces incentives for preemption or escalation based on miscalculation.\n\n        (c) Strategic Emphasis. This effect is advanced by: (i) credible readiness signals that demonstrate combined capability without unnecessary provocation; (ii) improved ability to operate through degraded information environments; and (iii) visible alliance cohesion, including integrated planning and shared understanding of the threat.\n\n4. COMMANDER’S INTENT.\n\n    a. Purpose. Derived directly from the “2022 National Defense Strategy of the United States of America,” the purpose of DoD efforts in the Western Pacific is to deter the pacing threat, reinforce allied and partner confidence, and preserve a free and open Indo-Pacific by integrating joint and combined capabilities to prevent aggression and ensure that the United States can prevail if deterrence fails.\n\n    b. Method. Consistent with NDS priorities of integrated deterrence, campaigning, and enduring advantages, U.S. INDOPACOM will:\n\n        (1) Integrate across domains and with allies and partners to present the pacing threat with multiple, simultaneous dilemmas—particularly under conditions of contested logistics, degraded communications, and intermittent space support—thereby reducing adversary confidence in a rapid, decisive action.\n\n        (2) Campaign persistently to strengthen alliances and partnerships, expand interoperability, and reduce the probability of conflict by shaping adversary decision-making and reinforcing international norms, including freedom of navigation and overflight.\n\n        (3) Build and demonstrate enduring advantages in posture resilience, logistics endurance, information security, and combined command and control. These advantages must be designed to persist when key space-enabled services are degraded or disrupted.\n\n        (4) Maintain strategic discipline: preserve escalation control, ensure actions are consistent with U.S. law and international obligations, and align messaging and force posture with national objectives to avoid inadvertent escalation while sustaining credible deterrence.\n\n    c. Key Tasks (Strategic-Level). The following strategic tasks guide theater alignment without prescribing operational detail:\n\n        (1) Ensure theater posture and coordination mechanisms enable rapid transition from competition to crisis response while preserving alliance cohesion and political decision space.\n\n        (2) Strengthen combined resilience against adversary information operations, cyber disruption, and counterspace activity that target decision-making and coalition unity.\n\n        (3) Advance sustainment resilience as a strategic advantage by prioritizing distributed support concepts, redundancy, and interoperability with allied and partner logistics systems.\n\n        (4) Support joint force readiness and modernization priorities consistent with “CJCSI 3170.01” principles for capability requirement alignment, ensuring that capability development and integration activities reinforce deterrence and operational resilience in the Western Pacific.\n\n    d. Risk and Restraints. The pacing threat benefits from ambiguity, speed, and attempts to fragment coalitions. U.S. efforts must avoid creating unnecessary strategic ambiguity among allies, must protect sensitive capabilities and sources, and must ensure that demonstrations of readiness do not undermine broader national objectives. Risk will be managed through disciplined escalation awareness, robust coordination with allies and the interagency, and continued emphasis on resilience rather than dependence on vulnerable nodes.\n\n    e. Desired Strategic Posture. The Joint Force will be perceived—by allies, partners, and the pacing threat—as credible, cohesive, and capable of sustained operations despite multi-domain disruption. The theater will be positioned to deny aggression, protect allied sovereignty, and maintain freedom of navigation and overflight, while sustaining the industrial and logistics base required for prolonged competition and potential conflict.\n\n5. ENDSTATE.\n\n    a. The United States, in concert with allies and partners, has established a stable deterrence posture in the Western Pacific in which the PRC is deterred from aggression and coercion because it assesses it cannot achieve its strategic objectives rapidly or at acceptable cost.\n\n    b. U.S. treaty allies and key security partners possess increased confidence in U.S. commitments and improved combined interoperability, including resilient coordination and sustainment mechanisms that function under contested communications and intermittent space support.\n\n    c. Freedom of navigation and overflight consistent with international law is preserved; critical sea lines of communication and undersea infrastructure are protected; and regional states retain political autonomy free from coercion.\n\n    d. The Joint Force has reinforced enduring advantages—logistics endurance, decision advantage, secure and resilient C2, and coalition integration—such that adversary attempts to create satellite coverage gaps, disrupt sustainment, or fracture alliances do not yield strategic gains.\n\n    e. Should deterrence fail, the Joint Force is postured—through integrated deterrence and campaigning—to transition rapidly to unified action that restores the status quo ante consistent with U.S. objectives and international obligations, while maintaining strategic discipline and alliance cohesion.",

      "content": "MEMORANDUM FOR: COMMANDER, UNITED STATES INDO-PACIFIC COMMAND\n\nFROM: CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF\n\nSUBJECT: National Military Strategy (NMS) Theater Annex — Western Pacific (INDOPACOM) Multi-Domain Joint Integration and Resilience (Effective 1–15 March 2026)\n\nDATE: 01 MAR 2026\n\nCLASSIFICATION: UNCLASSIFIED // FOUO\n\n\n1. PURPOSE.\n\n    a. This National Military Strategy (NMS) Theater Annex provides CJCS military-strategic guidance to Commander, U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (CDRUSINDOPACOM) for the Western Pacific during the effective period 010000Z MAR 2026 through 152359Z MAR 2026. This annex translates national strategic direction into theater-specific military strategic objectives, posture guidance, joint force requirements, and strategic lines of effort (LOEs) suitable to inform subordinate plans, orders, assessments, and exercise design.\n\n    b. This annex is explicitly derived from and implements the “National Defense Strategy (NDS) Extract — Integrated Deterrence and Enduring Advantages in the Western Pacific (Effective 1–15 March 2026),” dated 01 MAR 2026, signed by the Secretary of Defense (hereafter “NDS Extract”). Where this annex provides additional specificity, it remains consistent with the NDS Extract, Chairman’s statutory responsibilities, and joint doctrine, including JP 5-0, Joint Planning; JP 3-0, Joint Operations; JP 1, Doctrine for the Armed Forces of the United States; and CJCSI 3100.01 (Joint Strategic Planning System) principles.\n\n    c. This annex supports a multi-domain joint operation integration exercise with air/maritime/space integration and explicitly accounts for contested logistics, degraded communications, and intermittent satellite coverage. This annex does not direct tactical execution, target lists, or rules of engagement; it provides military-strategic guidance and required effects to shape theater actions and readiness.\n\n    d. Intended downstream users include: USINDOPACOM staff; component commands (PACFLT, PACAF, MARFORPAC, USARPAC, SOCPAC, USFK as applicable); USINDOPACOM JTF HQs; US Space Command (USSPACECOM) supporting elements; U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) supporting elements; Defense Logistics Agency (DLA); U.S. Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM); Missile Defense Agency coordination; and combined/allied headquarters coordinating within applicable agreements.\n\n\n2. STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENT.\n\n    a. Parent Authority and Strategic Framing. The NDS Extract (01 MAR 2026) establishes national-level priorities for INDOPACOM in the Western Pacific: DENY adversary strategic objectives; PROTECT decision advantage and alliance cohesion; DEGRADE adversary capacity for sustained multi-domain coercion; SUSTAIN forward presence under contested logistics and intermittent space support; and DESTROY adversary confidence in strategic surprise and escalation control. This annex operationalizes those strategic effects into theater military objectives, posture requirements, and joint capability integration guidance, consistent with JP 5-0 and JP 3-0.\n\n    b. Pacing Threat and Operating Conditions. A near-peer state adversary in the Pacific (consistent with the NDS Extract’s pacing threat framing) will employ A2/AD, long-range precision fires, counterspace, cyber, and information operations to delay U.S. response, disrupt C2, and fragment coalition cohesion. The operational environment includes: (1) contested electromagnetic spectrum; (2) cyber threats to mission networks and logistics systems; (3) intermittent PNT and satellite ISR coverage (due to adversary action, environment, and congestion); (4) risks to strategic lift, theater distribution, and key maritime choke points; and (5) persistent influence operations targeting regional populations and allied political decision-making.\n\n    c. Theater Geography and Posture Implications. The Western Pacific’s distances, constrained basing, and concentrated infrastructure increase risk from adversary long-range strike and sabotage. Posture must reduce single points of failure by distributing forces, enabling expeditionary basing, hardening critical nodes, and employing maneuver in multiple domains. JP 3-0 emphasizes that contested environments require resilient C2, protection, and the ability to “fight for information” and “fight through disruption.”\n\n    d. Alliance and Partner Context. The theater’s center of gravity includes political cohesion and operational interoperability among treaty allies and key partners. Execution must align with existing bilateral treaties, Status of Forces Agreements (SOFAs), and access arrangements (including but not limited to those with Japan, the Republic of Korea, Australia, the Philippines, and Thailand), and leverage operational frameworks such as combined planning mechanisms, intelligence-sharing agreements, and cross-servicing/logistics arrangements (e.g., ACSA). Coordination must preserve national caveats while enabling mission command under degraded communications.\n\n    e. Exercise Context (1–15 March 2026). The effective period includes a multi-domain joint integration exercise emphasizing air/maritime/space synchronization, contested logistics, and satellite coverage gaps. Exercise design and supporting operations must validate: (1) distributed and resilient C2; (2) assured logistics under disruption; (3) combined interoperability and rapid information sharing; (4) dynamic force employment and posture adaptation; and (5) disciplined escalation awareness consistent with strategic signaling objectives.\n\n\n3. STRATEGIC PRIORITIES (THEATER MILITARY STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND REQUIRED EFFECTS).\n\n    1) DENY adversary attainment of strategic objectives through rapid escalation or fait accompli in the Western Pacific.\n\n        a. Theater Military Objective. Establish and demonstrate credible, integrated, and distributed joint force capability—together with allies and partners—to deny the adversary the ability to seize and hold key terrain, isolate allies, or create a short-warning crisis that outpaces U.S./combined decision cycles.\n\n        b. Required Effects (Deny). Deny adversary confidence that it can: (1) achieve operational decision before U.S. reinforcement; (2) neutralize air and maritime power through initial salvos; (3) isolate treaty allies diplomatically and militarily; or (4) paralyze theater response by disrupting a small number of bases, ports, or communications nodes.\n\n        c. Posture Guidance. Maintain a posture mix that supports denial without undue provocation:\n            (1) Forward deployed: continuous naval presence (surface, subsurface, maritime patrol) and integrated air and missile defense (IAMD) readiness in coordination with allies; persistent combined maritime domain awareness.\n            (2) Rotational: bomber/air expeditionary rotations, rotational surface combatants, and expeditionary advanced basing elements to complicate adversary targeting and increase operational unpredictability.\n            (3) Surge capable: ready reinforcement packages and pre-coordinated reception, staging, onward movement, and integration (RSOI) mechanisms to transition rapidly from competition to crisis response.\n\n        d. Joint Force Requirements by Domain.\n            (1) Air: resilient sortie generation with dispersed operating locations; contested airspace control procedures per JP 3-52 (Joint Airspace Control) and JP 3-30 (Joint Air Operations); integrated counter-air with allied IAMD; survivable tanker and airlift employment concepts accounting for threatened airfields.\n            (2) Maritime: distributed maritime operations; undersea dominance to complicate adversary maritime maneuver; convoy planning and sea line of communications (SLOC) defense measures; coordination with USTRANSCOM for sea/air lift deconfliction.\n            (3) Space: prioritized theater support requests for missile warning, protected SATCOM, and alternative PNT solutions; planned operations under intermittent coverage (assumed gaps) with pre-briefed degradations.\n            (4) Cyber/EMS: assured mission network continuity and emissions control measures; defensive cyber posture to protect C2 and logistics systems that enable denial.\n\n        e. Justification (Doctrine). JP 3-0 states denial is achieved by credible capability and posture that prevents adversary objectives at acceptable cost/time. JP 5-0 directs planners to translate strategic objectives into achievable end states and tasks while accounting for constraints such as contested basing and communications.\n\n    2) PROTECT U.S. and allied decision advantage, mission command, and coalition cohesion under cyber, electromagnetic, information, and counterspace attack.\n\n        a. Theater Military Objective. Protect the integrity and continuity of theater mission command and shared operational understanding (SOU) across U.S. components and combined partners when primary pathways (SATCOM, ISR feeds, PNT, cloud services, and enterprise logistics systems) are degraded, disrupted, or denied.\n\n        b. Required Effects (Protect). Protect:\n            (1) Decision processes: maintain functional joint targeting/collection management, operational assessment, and commander’s decision cycles despite partial information and delayed connectivity.\n            (2) C2 pathways: preserve multiple transport layers (SATCOM, LOS, HF, tactical data links, undersea cable-dependent routes where applicable, and assured line-of-sight alternatives) with rehearsed failover.\n            (3) Coalition interoperability: maintain combined information-sharing and coordination mechanisms that function with intermittent connectivity and classification constraints; preserve trust through timely, consistent messaging and liaison integration.\n            (4) Integrity of logistics and deployment data: protect movement, force tracking, and sustainment systems from manipulation and disruption.\n\n        c. Command and Control Guidance. Consistent with JP 3-0 and JP 6-0 (Joint Communications System), USINDOPACOM will emphasize mission command through:\n            (1) Distributed C2 nodes with clear supported/supporting relationships, authorities, and triggers for C2 transition.\n            (2) Pre-planned communications windows and data prioritization (mission essential data first) to operate through satellite gaps.\n            (3) Robust liaison officer (LNO) architecture with allies/partners and among components to reduce dependence on continuous digital connectivity.\n            (4) Information discipline (OPSEC, emission control, and controlled disclosure) to reduce adversary targeting and influence leverage.\n\n        d. Joint Force Requirements by Domain.\n            (1) Cyber: defensive cyber operations to secure theater mission networks, logistics systems, and coalition enclaves; incident response playbooks; cyber mission assurance for key C2 nodes.\n            (2) Space: coordination with USSPACECOM for threat-informed space support planning; use of protected SATCOM where available; rapid reconfiguration procedures for contested space support.\n            (3) Air/Maritime/Land: degraded-mode tactics and procedures (TTPs) for navigation, timing, and targeting; alternative navigation aids; manual or low-bandwidth reporting procedures.\n\n        e. Alliance/Coalition Coordination. Employ standing frameworks (bilateral and multilateral) to ensure continuity:\n            (1) Activate combined coordination cells as appropriate; ensure LNO placement in key nodes.\n            (2) Utilize existing agreements (SOFAs, ACSA, information-sharing arrangements) to sustain interoperability while respecting national caveats.\n            (3) Synchronize strategic communications with allies/partners to counter disinformation and preserve coalition cohesion.\n\n        f. Justification (Doctrine). JP 3-0 emphasizes that information advantage enables operational advantage and that forces must “fight for information.” JP 3-12 (Cyberspace Operations) and JP 6-0 highlight resilient, secure, and redundant communications as essential to mission command. Protecting decision advantage is a strategic effect central to the NDS Extract and a prerequisite to all other theater objectives.\n\n    3) DEGRADE adversary ability to conduct sustained multi-domain coercion by disrupting key enabling functions (sensing, targeting, coordination, and sustainment).\n\n        a. Theater Military Objective. Reduce the adversary’s operational effectiveness by degrading its ability to find, fix, track, target, and engage (F2T2EA) joint and combined forces; degrade its ability to coordinate multi-domain fires and maintain coercive pressure over time.\n\n        b. Required Effects (Degrade). Degrade adversary:\n            (1) ISR and targeting quality: reduce accuracy, timeliness, and confidence in targeting solutions through deception, emissions control, maneuver, and counter-reconnaissance.\n            (2) Kill chain integration: disrupt synchronization of long-range fires, maritime and air denial, and supporting cyber/electromagnetic activities.\n            (3) Sustainment for coercion: reduce adversary capacity to generate sustained operational tempo (e.g., maritime patrol persistence, missile reload/repair cycles) through theater-wide dilemmas and operational uncertainty.\n            (4) Narrative leverage: degrade the credibility of coercive messaging by demonstrating coalition resilience and continuity of operations.\n\n        c. Joint Force Requirements by Domain.\n            (1) Air: integrated suppression and survivability measures, dynamic targeting processes, and airspace control methods per JP 3-30 and JP 3-52; emphasize low-signature operations and dispersed basing.\n            (2) Maritime: operations that complicate adversary maritime ISR and tracking; protection of undersea infrastructure and key maritime routes; layered defense against maritime reconnaissance-strike complexes.\n            (3) Space: employ operational concepts that assume intermittent overhead ISR; prioritize time-sensitive space support; integrate commercial and allied space-derived data where authorized and reliable.\n            (4) Cyber/EMS: offensive and defensive measures consistent with assigned authorities to disrupt adversary sensing/coordination while safeguarding friendly networks; spectrum awareness to identify and mitigate jamming and spoofing.\n\n        d. Exercise Integration. Ensure the exercise forces realistic degradation: scheduled satellite gaps; contested spectrum injects; cyber incident injects affecting logistics and C2; adversary ISR replication. Validate joint and combined ability to continue operations, assess effects, and adapt.\n\n        e. Justification (Doctrine). JP 3-0 and JP 3-30 emphasize integrated operations to create multiple dilemmas and reduce adversary effectiveness. Degrading enabling functions aligns with the NDS Extract’s emphasis on reducing adversary confidence in A2/AD and coercion without requiring continuous superiority in any single domain.\n\n    4) SUSTAIN the Joint Force and allied/partner operational endurance forward under contested logistics and intermittent space support.\n\n        a. Theater Military Objective. Sustain credible forward presence and the ability to surge and persist combat power by establishing resilient, distributed sustainment and mobility concepts that function under disruption, including attacks on ports, airfields, communications, and fuel/ammunition distribution.\n\n        b. Required Effects (Sustain). Sustain:\n            (1) Operational reach: maintain the ability to project and employ combat power despite contested movement corridors and degraded force tracking.\n            (2) Endurance: preserve sortie rates, steaming days, and readiness of forward forces with distributed resupply and maintenance.\n            (3) Coalition sustainment: enable combined logistics support and mutual aid within existing legal authorities and agreements.\n            (4) Reconstitution: restore degraded capabilities (C2 nodes, airfield operations, port throughput, critical spares) at a tempo that prevents adversary exploitation.\n\n        c. Posture and Logistics Guidance. In accordance with JP 4-0 (Joint Logistics), prioritize:\n            (1) Distribution and dispersion: reduce reliance on single hubs; pre-position critical munitions, fuel, and spares across multiple locations; employ expeditionary refueling and austere port/airfield operations where feasible.\n            (2) Mobility resilience: plan for contested sealift/airlift; rehearse alternate routing; integrate deception and protection measures for high-value logistics assets.\n            (3) Data and process resilience: establish manual/alternate procedures for requisition, asset visibility, and movement control when enterprise systems are degraded.\n            (4) Medical and personnel sustainment: ensure casualty evacuation, role-echeloning, and personnel replacement plans function under communications constraints and contested air/maritime routes.\n\n        d. Joint Force Requirements by Domain.\n            (1) Maritime: afloat logistics protection, underway replenishment resilience, and escort planning; port damage assessment and rapid restoration capabilities.\n            (2) Air: agile combat employment support; rapid runway repair; distributed maintenance and munitions handling; fuel distribution redundancy.\n            (3) Space/Cyber: protect and provide alternatives for logistics-related PNT and communications; defend logistics information systems from cyber disruption and data integrity attacks.\n            (4) Land: theater opening capabilities, expeditionary basing support, and protection of key nodes with integrated air and missile defense as available.\n\n        e. Alliance/Partner Sustainment. Leverage ACSA and bilateral logistics arrangements to expand support options; coordinate host-nation support and contracting within legal constraints; ensure customs, movement permissions, and SOFA-related processes are rehearsed to prevent friction during surge.\n\n        f. Justification (Doctrine). JP 4-0 identifies sustainment as decisive for operational reach and endurance and emphasizes that contested environments require adaptability and protection of sustainment networks. The NDS Extract frames logistics resilience as a strategic advantage necessary to persist forward under disruption and space degradation.\n\n    5) DESTROY adversary confidence in achieving strategic surprise and controlling escalation while preserving U.S. freedom of action and alliance credibility.\n\n        a. Theater Military Objective. Demonstrate credible readiness, rapid transition capability, and combined cohesion such that the adversary assesses it cannot achieve surprise, cannot limit conflict on favorable terms, and cannot fracture alliances through information operations or selective attacks on enabling infrastructure.\n\n        b. Required Effects (Destroy). Destroy adversary confidence that it can:\n            (1) Initiate aggression below the threshold of a unified response.\n            (2) Paralyze U.S./combined operations via limited strikes against C2, space support, or logistics nodes.\n            (3) Control escalation by threatening selective punishment while preventing U.S. denial operations.\n            (4) Exploit ambiguity and disinformation to erode allied political will.\n\n        c. Strategic Signaling and Escalation Discipline. Actions during the effective period must be:\n            (1) Credible: demonstrate integrated capabilities and continuity of operations under stress.\n            (2) Controlled: align with national messaging and avoid inadvertent escalation; maintain transparency with allies/partners to reduce miscalculation.\n            (3) Persistent: show that operations continue despite imposed friction (cyber, spectrum, space gaps, logistics disruption).\n\n        d. Readiness and Force Employment Guidance. Use dynamic force employment and distributed posture to complicate adversary planning; rehearse rapid C2 transitions; demonstrate reconstitution of degraded capabilities; integrate allied participation in visible but non-provocative readiness events consistent with political guidance.\n\n        e. Justification (Doctrine). JP 3-0 notes deterrence is strengthened when adversaries perceive the Joint Force can respond rapidly and effectively and can impose unacceptable costs. JP 1 emphasizes unified action with multinational partners. Destroying adversary confidence is a strategic psychological effect achieved through demonstrated resilience, cohesion, and readiness consistent with the NDS Extract.\n\n\n4. COMMANDER’S INTENT (DERIVED FROM PARENT GUIDANCE).\n\n    a. Purpose. In direct support of the NDS Extract (01 MAR 2026), the purpose of USINDOPACOM actions during 1–15 March 2026 is to strengthen integrated deterrence in the Western Pacific by demonstrating the Joint Force’s ability—together with allies and partners—to deny aggression, protect decision advantage, persist forward under contested logistics and intermittent space support, and rapidly transition from competition to crisis response while maintaining escalation discipline.\n\n    b. Method. USINDOPACOM will achieve this purpose by executing and validating theater campaigning tasks through the following strategic LOEs:\n\n        (1) LOE 1 — Integrated Multi-Domain Command and Control (MDC2) Resilience. Implement distributed mission command, redundant communications paths, and rehearsed C2 transitions; establish common operational picture practices that function under intermittent SATCOM and ISR; and integrate coalition LNO networks to preserve SOU.\n\n        (2) LOE 2 — Combined Denial Posture and Readiness. Employ forward-deployed and rotational forces to demonstrate credible denial capability, including coordinated air and maritime operations, IAMD readiness with allies, and rapid reinforcement drills; emphasize dispersal and survivability.\n\n        (3) LOE 3 — Contested Logistics and Operational Endurance. Execute distribution resilience measures, alternate routing, expeditionary sustainment concepts, and reconstitution drills; validate manual/alternate logistics processes and data integrity measures; coordinate with USTRANSCOM and DLA for stress-tested throughput.\n\n        (4) LOE 4 — Space/Cyber/EMS Degradation Operations and Fight-Through. Plan and operate under assumed satellite coverage gaps and contested spectrum; integrate cyber defense and mission assurance actions protecting C2 and logistics; rehearse degraded-mode navigation and targeting procedures.\n\n        (5) LOE 5 — Alliance Cohesion, Access, and Information Resilience. Synchronize combined planning and information-sharing; rehearse access, basing, and overflight/port clearance processes; coordinate counter-disinformation and public messaging support with appropriate interagency channels and allied counterparts.\n\n    c. Key Tasks (Theater-Strategic Level).\n        (1) Validate that USINDOPACOM and components can maintain operationally relevant mission command and execute prioritized tasks under intermittent satellite support for a sustained period (days, not hours).\n        (2) Demonstrate distributed posture and the ability to shift combat power and sustainment across multiple nodes without creating single points of failure.\n        (3) Exercise combined interoperability under realistic classification and releasability constraints; ensure coalition operations can proceed with partial connectivity and national caveats.\n        (4) Demonstrate protection of critical defense relationships by maintaining transparent coordination mechanisms, disciplined signaling, and consistent operational narratives aligned with national objectives.\n        (5) Provide CJCS-informed feedback to force development and integration processes consistent with CJCSI 3170.01 (capability requirement alignment), focusing on gaps revealed in contested logistics, C2 resilience, and space-enabled dependency.\n\n    d. Risk and Mitigation.\n        (1) Operational Risk: Overreliance on space-enabled services and enterprise networks. Mitigation: enforce planned degradations, prioritize mission-essential data, employ alternate nav/comm, and rehearse manual procedures.\n        (2) Strategic Risk: Misinterpretation of readiness activities as escalatory. Mitigation: align with national and allied messaging; employ calibrated visibility; maintain deconfliction channels as directed.\n        (3) Coalition Risk: Interoperability shortfalls and information-sharing friction. Mitigation: LNO architecture, pre-coordinated releasability, combined SOPs for degraded comms, and clear supported/supporting relationships.\n        (4) Sustainment Risk: Throughput disruption and asset visibility loss. Mitigation: distribute stocks, alternate routing, convoy/escort planning, and redundant tracking methods.\n\n    e. Desired Endstate (Commander’s Intent). At the conclusion of the effective period, the Joint Force—together with allies and partners—has demonstrably improved its ability to deny adversary coercion or rapid escalation; protect decision advantage and mission command; degrade adversary enabling functions by operating unpredictably and resiliently; and sustain forward combat power despite contested logistics and intermittent space support, thereby reinforcing deterrence consistent with the NDS Extract.\n\n\n5. ENDSTATE.\n\n    a. Deterrence Posture Reinforced. The adversary assesses it cannot achieve strategic objectives rapidly or at acceptable cost due to credible, distributed, and integrated U.S./combined denial capabilities and demonstrated readiness to transition rapidly from competition to crisis response.\n\n    b. Decision Advantage Preserved Under Degradation. USINDOPACOM and components demonstrate mission command continuity and timely decision-making despite imposed satellite coverage gaps, contested spectrum, and cyber/logistics disruptions; coalition coordination remains functional through redundant pathways and LNO integration.\n\n    c. Adversary Coercion Capacity Reduced in Practical Terms. The Joint Force demonstrates operational patterns, dispersal, emissions control, and multi-domain coordination that reduce adversary ISR/targeting confidence and complicate planning for sustained coercive pressure.\n\n    d. Forward Endurance Validated. Theater sustainment concepts prove capable of supporting forward presence and surge operations with distributed stocks, alternate routing, and reconstitution procedures; combined logistics arrangements are exercised and improved within existing legal authorities and agreements.\n\n    e. Alliance Cohesion and Access Strengthened. Allies and partners demonstrate effective combined interoperability, access/basing processes, and coordinated messaging; political confidence is reinforced by visible operational competence and disciplined escalation management.\n\n    f. Capability and Planning Feedback Produced. USINDOPACOM provides CJCS-ready observations and recommendations identifying capability gaps, policy/process friction points, and priority investments—particularly in resilient C2, contested logistics, space support alternatives, and coalition interoperability—consistent with CJCSI 3170.01 and joint lessons learned processes.\n\nUNCLASSIFIED // FOUO",

PURPOSE.\n\n    a. This Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan (JSCP) tasking memorandum provides directed planning guidance, force apportionment priorities, and executable planning requirements to Commander, U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (CDRUSINDOPACOM) for the period 010000Z MAR 2026 through 152359Z MAR 2026, in support of a multi-domain joint operation integration exercise emphasizing air/maritime/space integration under contested logistics and intermittent satellite coverage.\n\n    b. This JSCP is explicitly derived from and implements the parent authority: “National Military Strategy (NMS) Theater Annex — Western Pacific (INDOPACOM) Multi-Domain Joint Integration and Resilience (Effective 1–15 March 2026),” dated 01 MAR 2026 (hereafter “NMS Theater Annex”). Where this JSCP provides additional detail, it remains consistent with the NMS Theater Annex and controlling joint doctrine, including JP 5-0 (Joint Planning), JP 3-0 (Joint Operations), JP 1 (Doctrine for the Armed Forces of the United States), JP 3-30 (Joint Air Operations), JP 3-52 (Joint Airspace Control), JP 4-0 (Joint Logistics), JP 6-0 (Joint Communications System), JP 3-12 (Cyberspace Operations), and CJCSI 3100.01 (Joint Strategic Planning System). Capability gap reporting and recommendations will align with CJCSI 3170.01 (Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System) and applicable Joint Lessons Learned processes.\n\n    c. This tasking directs theater-strategic planning and coordination requirements and apportions forces and capabilities for planning and exercise execution. It does not prescribe tactical execution, rules of engagement, or target lists.\n\n    d. Desired outcome: produce CJCS- and Secretary of Defense-relevant readiness evidence and planning products demonstrating USINDOPACOM’s ability to DENY adversary objectives, PROTECT decision advantage, DEGRADE adversary enabling functions, SUSTAIN contested logistics, and DESTROY adversary confidence in strategic surprise and escalation control, as required by the NMS Theater Annex.\n\n\n2. STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENT.\n\n    a. Parent authority reference. The NMS Theater Annex (01 MAR 2026) assesses a near-peer Pacific state adversary employing A2/AD, long-range precision fires, counterspace actions, cyber operations, and information operations to disrupt U.S./combined C2, logistics, and coalition cohesion. The Annex directs validation of joint integration with realistic degradations, including scheduled satellite coverage gaps and contested electromagnetic spectrum conditions.\n\n    b. Operational problem framing for this JSCP. For the Western Pacific, the joint force must demonstrate the ability to maintain mission command, generate and employ distributed combat power, and sustain operational endurance when: (1) SATCOM/ISR/PNT are intermittent; (2) logistics data systems are degraded or manipulated; (3) ports/airfields and distribution nodes are threatened; and (4) coalition interoperability must function with releasability constraints and limited bandwidth. Consistent with JP 3-0, forces must be prepared to “fight for information,” operate through disruption, and transition rapidly between competition activities and crisis response without losing escalation discipline.\n\n    c. Assumptions and constraints for planning (exercise-realistic). Planners will assume: (1) intermittent space support with defined coverage gaps (hours-to-days); (2) cyber incidents affecting non-classified logistics networks and select mission enclaves; (3) contested spectrum with periodic jamming/spoofing injects impacting tactical data links and navigation; (4) movement restrictions and delayed clearances to simulate political and infrastructure friction; and (5) adversary ISR replication sufficient to impose signature management requirements. Constraints: execute within existing treaties, SOFAs, access agreements, and national caveats; preserve calibrated signaling; and coordinate public messaging via established interagency and combined channels.\n\n\n3. STRATEGIC PRIORITIES (TASKS, EFFECTS, AND DOCTRINAL JUSTIFICATION).\n\n    CDRUSINDOPACOM will execute the following theater-strategic priorities, each tied to effects articulated in the NMS Theater Annex. For each priority, USINDOPACOM will translate the effect into CCDR tasks (JP 5-0: objectives, tasks, and required effects) and provide assessment measures and lessons learned.\n\n    3.1. Priority 1 — DENY adversary attainment of rapid fait accompli and short-warning escalation.\n\n        a. Required effect (DENY). Deny adversary confidence that it can achieve operational decision prior to U.S./combined response by neutralizing a small number of bases, ports, or key communications nodes, consistent with the NMS Theater Annex, para 3.1.\n\n        b. CCDR tasks (USINDOPACOM).\n            (1) Establish and exercise a theater denial posture plan integrating PACFLT, PACAF, MARFORPAC, USARPAC, SOCPAC, and USSPACECOM supporting elements, emphasizing distributed basing and maritime maneuver.\n            (2) Validate Joint Force entry and rapid reinforcement procedures under constrained RSOI, including austere/divert operations and contested air/maritime corridors; include at least one theater-wide reposition event that forces cross-component deconfliction.\n            (3) Exercise integrated air and missile defense (IAMD) readiness coordination with allies/partners (as applicable) and demonstrate continuity of airspace control procedures under degraded networks, consistent with JP 3-52.\n            (4) Demonstrate distributed maritime operations, including convoy/escort planning for high-value logistics movements and at-sea sustainment protection measures.\n            (5) Produce a theater denial readiness assessment brief to CJCS NLT 151800Z MAR 2026 summarizing denial posture effectiveness, friction points (access, clearances, throughput), and recommended improvements.\n\n        c. Force allocation and apportionment guidance (planning and execution priorities).\n            (1) Apportion for planning: 1 Carrier Strike Group (CSG) and 1 Expeditionary Strike Group (ESG) available within theater or able to surge within 10 days; 8–10 fighter squadrons (mix of 4th/5th gen); 1–2 bomber tasking packages (BTF-style); and enabling ISR/EW, tanker, and airlift support as specified in para 3.6.\n            (2) Prioritize survivability and dispersal: PACAF will plan for Agile Combat Employment (ACE) using multiple operating locations, including at least two austere/divert locations with reduced comms support.\n            (3) Prioritize undersea and maritime domain awareness to complicate adversary targeting and reinforce denial.\n\n        d. Justification (doctrine). JP 3-0 emphasizes denial through credible, distributed capability and posture that prevent adversary objectives at acceptable cost/time. JP 3-30 and JP 3-52 require integrated air operations and airspace control that persist under contested conditions; JP 5-0 directs translation of strategic effects into executable tasks and assessments.\n\n    3.2. Priority 2 — PROTECT decision advantage, mission command, and coalition cohesion under cyber/EMS/counterspace attack.\n\n        a. Required effect (PROTECT). Protect continuity of mission command and shared operational understanding during intermittent SATCOM/ISR/PNT and cyber/logistics disruptions, consistent with the NMS Theater Annex, para 3.2.\n\n        b. CCDR tasks (USINDOPACOM).\n            (1) Establish, exercise, and assess a distributed C2 construct (to include alternate/auxiliary C2 nodes) with clearly defined supported/supporting relationships and triggers for transition (e.g., primary JOC degradation, loss of SATCOM beyond pre-set thresholds).\n            (2) Implement preplanned communications windows, mission-essential data prioritization, and manual/low-bandwidth reporting procedures across components; rehearse at least two deliberate “C2 failover” events during the exercise.\n            (3) Activate and employ a theater LNO architecture (U.S. inter-component and combined) to reduce dependence on continuous digital connectivity; require each component to identify minimum essential coordination requirements deliverable by LNO/hard copy/voice-only.\n            (4) Coordinate with USCYBERCOM (supported/supporting as appropriate) and Service cyber components to execute defensive cyber operations and incident response playbooks protecting mission networks and logistics systems; include at least one data integrity incident inject affecting movement/force tracking.\n            (5) Coordinate with USSPACECOM to operationalize “degraded space support” battle drills, including alternate PNT procedures and protected SATCOM prioritization; validate PNT-denied navigation procedures for select air and maritime events.\n\n        c. Coordination requirements (interagency and combined).\n            (1) Establish a combined information-sharing plan addressing releasability constraints and intermittent connectivity; use existing agreements and combined mechanisms; ensure coalition partners can operate with partial data feeds.\n            (2) Synchronize strategic communications themes and deconfliction pathways with appropriate interagency channels and allied counterparts to preserve escalation discipline (consistent with NMS Theater Annex, para 3.5).\n\n        d. Justification (doctrine). JP 6-0 requires resilient and redundant communications for mission command; JP 3-12 and JP 3-0 emphasize defensive cyberspace operations and the need to fight for information advantage; JP 1 underscores unity of effort with multinational partners as a center of gravity.\n\n    3.3. Priority 3 — DEGRADE adversary enabling functions (sensing, targeting, coordination, sustainment) through joint/combined operational patterns.\n\n        a. Required effect (DEGRADE). Degrade adversary F2T2EA quality and kill chain integration by reducing targeting confidence, disrupting coordination, and imposing operational uncertainty, consistent with the NMS Theater Annex, para 3.3.\n\n        b. CCDR tasks (USINDOPACOM).\n            (1) Direct components to implement signature management, emissions control (EMCON), deception, and maneuver plans that measurably reduce adversary ISR replication effectiveness (exercise red-cell) against friendly critical assets.\n            (2) Exercise joint ISR synchronization that accounts for intermittent space-based ISR; integrate commercial and allied-derived data where authorized and reliable; develop an ISR triage plan prioritizing time-sensitive requirements during coverage gaps.\n            (3) Validate dynamic targeting processes and “degraded sensor” strike planning across air and maritime components consistent with JP 3-30, emphasizing the ability to shift between deliberate and dynamic cycles when data feeds are delayed.\n            (4) Exercise counter-reconnaissance and maritime domain awareness operations that complicate adversary tracking of logistics movements and distributed basing operations.\n            (5) Produce a DEGRADE effects assessment methodology (observable indicators and measures of performance/effect) suitable for reuse in future INDOPACOM exercises and contingency planning.\n\n        c. Justification (doctrine). JP 3-0 and JP 3-30 emphasize integrated operations that create multiple dilemmas and reduce adversary effectiveness without requiring continuous dominance in one domain. JP 5-0 requires assessment plans tied to objectives and effects, including indicators suitable for commander decision-making.\n\n    3.4. Priority 4 — SUSTAIN forward operational endurance under contested logistics and intermittent space support.\n\n        a. Required effect (SUSTAIN). Sustain operational reach, endurance, and reconstitution despite disrupted throughput, degraded asset visibility, and threats to ports/airfields, consistent with the NMS Theater Annex, para 3.4.\n\n        b. CCDR tasks (USINDOPACOM).\n            (1) Execute a theater distribution resilience plan that reduces reliance on single hubs; demonstrate distributed stocks (fuel, critical munitions, spares) across multiple locations and afloat where feasible.\n            (2) In coordination with USTRANSCOM and DLA, rehearse contested mobility: alternate routing, degraded in-transit visibility procedures, convoy/escort coordination for high-value movements, and rapid reroute decision-making during simulated threat to chokepoints.\n            (3) Validate expeditionary logistics capabilities: austere airfield operations, rapid runway repair planning integration, expeditionary refueling points, and limited-communications requisition procedures.\n            (4) Establish manual/alternate processes for requisition, asset visibility, and movement control when enterprise systems are degraded; include a forced transition to manual tracking for at least 24 hours during the period.\n            (5) Validate medical and personnel sustainment under contested routes: casualty evacuation coordination, patient movement under communications constraints, and personnel replacement planning.\n\n        c. Force protection integration for sustainment nodes.\n            (1) Incorporate protection of critical sustainment nodes into IAMD and base defense planning to the maximum extent feasible; prioritize defense of fuel distribution, munitions handling, key C2 nodes supporting movement control, and expeditionary operating locations.\n\n        d. Justification (doctrine). JP 4-0 emphasizes sustainment as decisive for operational reach and endurance and requires adaptability and protection of sustainment networks in contested environments. JP 3-0 notes that logistics under attack is a central feature of modern joint operations and must be trained and assessed realistically.\n\n    3.5. Priority 5 — DESTROY adversary confidence in strategic surprise and escalation control through demonstrated readiness, resilience, and disciplined signaling.\n\n        a. Required effect (DESTROY). Destroy adversary confidence that it can initiate aggression below the threshold of unified response, paralyze operations via limited attacks on enablers, or fracture alliances through disinformation and selective strikes, consistent with the NMS Theater Annex, para 3.5.\n\n        b. CCDR tasks (USINDOPACOM).\n            (1) Conduct visible but controlled readiness events demonstrating rapid C2 transition, distributed posture shifts, and reconstitution of degraded capabilities (e.g., restoration of airfield operations or comms reroute) without creating escalatory signaling.\n            (2) Synchronize combined participation to emphasize alliance cohesion and operational competence; document and mitigate interoperability friction (releasability, comm pathways, logistics authorities).\n            (3) Demonstrate continuity of operations during imposed satellite gaps and cyber/EMS disruption while maintaining safe operations and disciplined EMCON/OPSEC.\n            (4) Provide CJCS a post-exercise deterrence and signaling assessment: what actions most effectively conveyed readiness and resilience, and what actions created risk of misinterpretation.\n\n        c. Justification (doctrine). JP 3-0 describes deterrence as a function of credible capability, readiness, and perceived will; JP 1 emphasizes unified action and the strategic importance of alliances; JP 5-0 requires that operational design consider risk, signaling, and strategic communication implications.\n\n\n    3.6. Force sizing and planning apportionment (baseline for 1–15 March 2026).\n\n        a. This apportionment is for planning and exercise execution; availability is subject to SecDef orders, global force management, and emergent contingency demands. USINDOPACOM will prioritize employment concepts that remain effective if actual forces are reduced (graceful degradation).\n\n        b. FORCE SIZING TABLE (planning baseline).\n          * Required fighter squadrons: 10 (minimum 8 mission-capable for sustained operations under dispersion)\n          * Required bomber taskings: 2 (BTF-style packages; at least one long-range maritime strike/anti-surface training event and one theater-wide dynamic retask event)\n          * Required CSG/ESG: 2 total (1 CSG + 1 ESG; minimum 1 major naval task group continuously available)\n          * Required ISR/EW support: 6 (2 maritime ISR sorties/day equivalent, 2 high-demand air ISR lines, 2 EW/EA-capable airborne or stand-in support taskings; augmented by national/commercial where authorized)\n          * Required tanker orbits: 6 (4 steady-state distributed orbits + 2 surge/contingency orbits to support dispersal and reroute)\n\n        c. Additional enabling guidance.\n            (1) Airlift/sealift: USTRANSCOM coordination required for at least one large movement event and one reroute/port diversion drill; include degraded in-transit visibility injects.\n            (2) Space support: coordinate prioritized protected SATCOM and missile warning support requests through USSPACECOM; plan for intermittent coverage as a primary condition, not an exception.\n            (3) Cyber support: coordinate defensive cyber mission assurance activities with USCYBERCOM and Service cyber components; prioritize protection of movement control, fuel accountability, and munitions tracking systems.\n\n        d. Force employment priorities under constraint.\n            (1) If fighter capacity is constrained, prioritize counter-air, maritime strike support, and defense of distributed operating locations over non-essential presence sorties.\n            (2) If naval forces are constrained, prioritize SLOC defense planning, undersea advantage preservation, and protection of logistics movements.\n            (3) If tanker capacity is constrained, prioritize dispersal sustainment, medical evacuation contingencies, and critical long-range strike support.\n\n\n4. COMMANDER’S INTENT (EXERCISE AND PLANNING INTENT; DERIVED FROM PARENT GUIDANCE).\n\n    a. Purpose (derived). Consistent with the NMS Theater Annex, the purpose of USINDOPACOM actions from 1–15 March 2026 is to strengthen integrated deterrence by demonstrating the Joint Force’s ability—together with allies and partners—to DENY aggression, PROTECT decision advantage and mission command, DEGRADE adversary enabling functions through operational patterns and resilience, SUSTAIN forward endurance under contested logistics and intermittent space support, and DESTROY adversary confidence in strategic surprise and escalation control.\n\n    b. Method.\n        (1) Execute a multi-domain integration exercise employing distributed C2, ACE and distributed maritime operations, and contested logistics play that forces decisions under uncertainty.\n        (2) Plan for and deliberately impose degradations (space, cyber, EMS, logistics systems) with rehearsed failover and manual procedures; measure performance and decision quality.\n        (3) Integrate combined and interagency coordination through LNO networks, releasability-aware information sharing, and synchronized messaging.\n\n    c. Key tasks (commander-level).\n        (1) Maintain mission command and operationally relevant decision cycles for multiple days under intermittent SATCOM and ISR, validating preplanned comm windows and alternate C2 nodes.\n        (2) Demonstrate the ability to shift and sustain combat power across distributed nodes while protecting key logistics and C2 enablers.\n        (3) Produce CJCS-ready findings: priority capability gaps, policy/process constraints, and recommended DOTMLPF-P actions consistent with CJCSI 3170.01.\n\n    d. Planning products required (deliverables).\n        (1) OPLAN/CONPLAN development and refinement (JP 5-0 compliant):\n            (a) CONPLAN (Level 2–3 detail) — “Western Pacific Contested Logistics Continuity”: theater distribution resilience, manual asset visibility, alternate routing, convoy/escort planning, and reconstitution triggers.\n            (b) CONPLAN (Level 2–3 detail) — “Degraded Space Operations (DSO) Fight-Through”: comm/PNT/ISR degradation playbooks, comm windows, data prioritization, and operational risk controls.\n            (c) CONPLAN (Level 2–3 detail) — “Distributed C2 Transition and Continuity”: supported/supporting relationships, C2 node transition triggers, minimum essential data sets, and LNO architecture.\n            (d) OPLAN fragment update (as applicable to existing approved theater plans) — annex addendum capturing MDJIR exercise lessons learned and incorporating validated TTP for degraded operations.\n        (2) Assessment plan: USINDOPACOM will develop an assessment framework with measures of performance/effect tied to the five effects (DENY/PROTECT/DEGRADE/SUSTAIN/DESTROY) and submit to CJCS J-7 NLT 101800Z MAR 2026 for alignment with joint lessons learned collection.\n        (3) After Action Report (AAR): provide CJCS an executive summary NLT 201800Z MAR 2026 and a detailed staff AAR NLT 291800Z MAR 2026 including: capability gaps, interoperability issues, logistics bottlenecks, comm resilience outcomes, and recommended investments/priorities.\n\n    e. Coordination requirements with adjacent CCDRs and supporting commands.\n        (1) U.S. Northern Command (as required) for homeland defense implications of cyber incidents affecting logistics networks (informational coordination).\n        (2) U.S. European Command (USEUCOM): coordinate for competing global force demands and to deconflict strategic lift and bomber tasking schedules; establish a liaison arrangement to manage cross-theater air refueling and ISR allocation friction.\n        (3) U.S. Central Command (USCENTCOM): coordinate to deconflict tanker and ISR apportionment, ensure continuity of high-demand/low-density assets, and establish procedures for rapid reallocation if emergent CENTCOM requirements arise.\n        (4) USTRANSCOM: coordinate contested mobility injects, alternate routing, port diversion drills, and in-transit visibility degradation play; ensure command relationships and authorities are clearly documented.\n        (5) USSPACECOM and USCYBERCOM: coordinate support plans and battle drills; ensure authorities and reporting thresholds are understood and exercised without delay.\n\n    f. Risk guidance (derived).\n        (1) Overreliance on space-enabled services and enterprise networks is a primary operational risk; mitigation requires enforcing degradations, rehearsing manual processes, and prioritizing mission-essential information.\n        (2) Strategic misinterpretation risk requires calibrated visibility, transparent ally coordination, and disciplined messaging; avoid actions that could be construed as preparations for imminent offensive operations beyond exercise scope.\n        (3) Coalition friction risk requires LNO architecture, pre-coordinated releasability, and procedures that work with intermittent connectivity.\n\n\n5. ENDSTATE.\n\n    a. Denial posture and readiness demonstrably improved. The Joint Force and combined partners demonstrate credible, distributed denial capabilities in the Western Pacific, including the ability to disperse, defend, and continue operations when primary nodes are threatened or degraded, consistent with the NMS Theater Annex endstate.\n\n    b. Decision advantage preserved under degradation. USINDOPACOM demonstrates mission command continuity for days under intermittent satellite coverage, contested EMS, and cyber/logistics disruptions, with functioning alternate C2 nodes, comm windows, and manual procedures that preserve decision quality.\n\n    c. Adversary enabling functions practically degraded (validated by exercise replication). Friendly operational patterns, signature management, and multi-domain coordination reduce adversary ISR/targeting confidence in the exercise construct and provide reusable methods for future contingency application.\n\n    d. Forward endurance validated under contested logistics. Theater sustainment and mobility concepts demonstrate distributed stocks, alternate routing, protection of high-value logistics movements, and reconstitution capabilities; manual asset visibility procedures function sufficiently to sustain operations when enterprise systems are degraded.\n\n    e. Alliance cohesion and access strengthened. Combined interoperability improves through rehearsed access, basing, overflight/port clearance processes, and releasability-aware information sharing; coalition messaging and coordination remain coherent during disruption.\n\n    f. CJCS-ready capability and planning feedback produced. USINDOPACOM delivers prioritized observations and recommendations aligned to CJCSI 3170.01, highlighting gaps and investment priorities in resilient C2, contested logistics, space support alternatives, EMS maneuver, and combined interoperability for the Western Pacific operating environment.\n\nUNCLASSIFIED // FOUO",

PURPOSE.\n\n    This CONPLAN translates CJCS JSCP MDJIR tasking into an executable theater operational concept for a multi-domain joint integration exercise emphasizing air/maritime/space integration under contested logistics and intermittent satellite coverage gaps (010000Z MAR 2026 through 152359Z MAR 2026). This CONPLAN provides the operational framework that will drive ORBAT refinement, daily ATO/ACO development, joint movement and distribution scheduling, and assessment/lessons learned in accordance with JP 5-0 and JP 3-0.\n\n\n3. SITUATION.\n\n    a. Adversary (Near-peer Pacific state adversary) — capabilities and intent (exercise-realistic).\n\n        (1) Strategic intent (as replicated for MDJIR). Adversary seeks to achieve a rapid operational fait accompli within the First Island Chain by leveraging short-warning escalation, A2/AD, and information/cyber/counterspace operations to delay or fragment U.S./combined response, while shaping political decision-making through calibrated coercion and ambiguity.\n\n        (2) A2/AD and long-range fires. Adversary fields a layered strike complex (land-based anti-ship and land-attack missiles; air- and maritime-launched cruise missiles; long-range rocket artillery in proximate areas; and integrated fires supported by ISR). Adversary targeting emphasizes fixed and semi-fixed nodes: major ports, primary airfields, POL storage, and visible C2 emitters. Adversary employs salvo tactics intended to overwhelm point defenses and complicate base recovery operations.\n\n        (3) Maritime and undersea. Adversary uses surface action groups, submarines, maritime patrol aircraft, and unmanned maritime systems to contest sea lines of communication (SLOCs), threaten high-value logistics shipping, and impose risk on replenishment at sea. Adversary will prioritize locating and tracking U.S. carrier/amphibious groups while forcing dispersal and defensive postures.\n\n        (4) Air and IADS. Adversary employs modern fighter aircraft, long-range air-to-air missiles, and an integrated air defense system (IADS) with overlapping sensors and SAM coverage. The IADS is designed to stress tanker support, reduce time-on-station, and force the joint force to operate from extended ranges and distributed locations. Adversary uses electronic attack to degrade data links and disrupt airspace coordination.\n\n        (5) Cyber and information. Adversary conducts cyber operations to disrupt non-classified logistics networks, manipulate movement/force tracking data, and create uncertainty in sustainment and force posture. Adversary information operations attempt to fracture coalition cohesion and exploit the friction of movement restrictions and access delays.\n\n        (6) Space and electromagnetic spectrum (EMS). Adversary conducts counterspace activities (reversible effects, dazzling, interference) and GPS spoofing/jamming to degrade PNT and ISR. Adversary targets SATCOM links and exploits predictable network behaviors. MDJIR will replicate intermittent satellite coverage gaps (hours-to-days) and periodic data-link interference events.\n\n        (7) Most likely adversary approach during MDJIR. Demonstrate “detect-decide-strike-assess” kill chain attempts against joint force C2 and logistics nodes, combined with EMS/cyber disruptions designed to force manual processes and degrade tempo.\n\n        (8) Adversary constraints (exercise). Actions remain bounded to simulated effects; no real-world ROE changes are implied. No target lists or lethal effects are required for MDJIR; replication focuses on decision-making, resilience, and continuity of operations.\n\n    b. Friendly forces and support relationships (notional allocation consistent with JSCP apportionment).\n\n        (1) Supported commander. CDRUSINDOPACOM is the supported commander for theater MDJIR execution.\n\n        (2) Key supporting commanders/components and typical responsibilities (JP 3-0; JP 5-0).\n            (a) PACFLT: maritime maneuver, sea control/sea denial, convoy/escort planning, maritime strike integration, undersea coordination, and at-sea sustainment protection.\n            (b) PACAF: joint air operations (with JFACC construct as designated), Agile Combat Employment (ACE), air mobility coordination, tanker management, and airbase resiliency playbooks.\n            (c) MARFORPAC: littoral operations, expeditionary advanced base operations (EABO) experimentation, air defense and fires integration (exercise), and expeditionary logistics nodes (ELNs).\n            (d) USARPAC: theater sustainment posture, air and missile defense coordination (exercise), multi-domain effects coordination cells, and land-based distribution nodes.\n            (e) SOCPAC: liaison architecture, low-signature reconnaissance/sensing concepts (exercise), and crisis response planning integration.\n            (f) USSPACECOM (supporting): degraded space support battle drills, protected SATCOM prioritization, alternate PNT procedures, and space ISR coordination within exercise constraints.\n            (g) USCYBERCOM/Service cyber components (supporting): defensive cyber operations (DCO), incident response, and data integrity remediation for logistics and mission networks.\n\n        (3) Combined/allied/partner participation (exercise planning). Participation and access are bounded by standing agreements and national caveats. The CONPLAN assumes a combined coordination layer enabling: (a) shared airspace control measures where authorized; (b) information-sharing with releasability constraints; (c) limited bandwidth and intermittent connectivity; and (d) partner operations with partial data feeds.\n\n    c. Theater geography and operating environment.\n\n        (1) Operating area. Western Pacific theater with focus on the First and Second Island Chains, key maritime chokepoints, and distributed basing network across allied and U.S. territories. Operations will be executed with an assumption of adversary ISR replication sufficient to impose signature management requirements.\n\n        (2) Physical factors. Long distances, limited hardened infrastructure at austere locations, finite ramp space and fuel capacity, and weather impacts (seasonal turbulence, maritime state). These factors will be used to stress distribution and sortie generation.\n\n        (3) Information environment. Intermittent SATCOM coverage, periodic PNT degradation, contested EMS, and degraded logistics data systems are assumed. The operational design must “fight for information” (JP 3-0) and preserve mission command continuity through redundancy and disciplined communications (JP 6-0).\n\n\n4. MISSION STATEMENT.\n\n    USINDOPACOM conducts MDJIR (1–15 March 2026) in the Western Pacific to demonstrate and assess multi-domain joint force integration and resilience by (1) denying adversary confidence in achieving a rapid fait accompli through distributed posture and integrated air/maritime maneuver; (2) protecting decision advantage and coalition cohesion through resilient C2 under cyber/EMS/counterspace disruption; and (3) sustaining contested logistics and distributed operations despite intermittent satellite coverage gaps and degraded data systems, in order to provide CJCS/OSD readiness evidence, validated battle drills, and capability gap recommendations in accordance with JP 5-0, JP 3-0, JP 3-52, and CJCSI 3170.01.\n\n\n5. CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS.\n\n    a. Commander’s intent.\n\n        (1) Purpose. Validate that the joint force can maintain mission command, generate combat power from distributed locations, and sustain operational endurance when space and cyberspace support are degraded and logistics nodes are threatened.\n\n        (2) Method. Employ a theater-wide distributed C2 construct with deliberate failovers; integrate PACFLT maritime maneuver with PACAF ACE; conduct convoy/escort planning and at-sea sustainment protection; execute airspace control continuity drills under degraded networks; and stress the distribution system with access delays and data integrity injects.\n\n        (3) End state. Joint force demonstrates credible denial posture; C2 remains continuous despite intermittent SATCOM/ISR/PNT; logistics sustains distributed operations with measured throughput and recovery timelines; coalition coordination functions with partial data; and USINDOPACOM delivers a readiness assessment and capability gap recommendations to CJCS NLT 151800Z MAR 2026.\n\n    b.

Decisive Points (DPs) for MDJIR assessment.\n\n        DP1 — Distributed C2 Effective Transition.\n            Condition: Successful transition to alternate/auxiliary C2 node within established time threshold while maintaining ATO/ACO continuity and command authorities (JP 6-0). Measure: time to re-establish minimum essential C2 services; number of missed/late critical reports; operational impacts.\n\n        DP2 — ACE Sustainment at Austere Locations.\n            Condition: Sustained generation of sorties from dispersed/austere locations with reduced comms and constrained fuel/munitions handling. Measure: sortie generation rate vs plan; refuel/rearm cycle times; maintenance recovery; safety deviations.\n\n        DP3 — Contested Distribution Reroute and Recovery.\n            Condition: Logistics flow maintained after simulated denial of a primary port/airfield/distribution node and compromise of logistics tracking data. Measure: time to reroute; throughput achieved; inventory accuracy after reconciliation; impact on operational tempo.\n\n        DP4 — Airspace Control Continuity Under Degraded Networks.\n            Condition: Airspace deconfliction maintained during datalink disruptions and intermittent SATCOM via procedural measures and preplanned airspace control measures (JP 3-52). Measure: number of deconfliction incidents; timeliness of ACO updates; controller workload and clarity.\n\n        DP5 — Convoy/Escort and At-Sea Sustainment Protection (Procedural).\n            Condition: High-value logistics movement planned and executed (exercise) with layered defense and dynamic rerouting under ISR threat replication. Measure: adherence to escort plan; responsiveness to reroute triggers; communications discipline; risk acceptance documentation.\n\n    e. Scheme of maneuver (exercise-level; no target lists; procedural focus).\n\n        (1) Joint Force posture and maneuver.\n            (a) Maritime. PACFLT will operate a notional CSG and ESG in dispersed operating areas to validate maritime maneuver, escort concepts, and sea-based sustainment protection. Undersea coordination will emphasize maritime domain awareness and deconfliction with logistics shipping routes.\n            (b) Air. PACAF will execute ACE with multiple operating locations to complicate adversary targeting and to validate command relationships and sustainment. A bomber tasking package (BTF-style) will be integrated procedurally to stress tanker planning, airspace control measures, and comm windows.\n            (c) Land and littoral. USARPAC and MARFORPAC will support establishment and sustainment of expeditionary logistics nodes and limited, exercise-focused EABO constructs, primarily to stress distribution, communications, and protection coordination.\n            (d) Space/cyber/EMS. USSPACECOM support will implement scheduled coverage gaps and PNT degradation injects; USCYBERCOM/Service cyber will run defensive playbooks and incident response to logistics data manipulation scenarios.\n\n        (2) Fires and effects integration (exercise). MDJIR will validate joint processes for integrating effects (air/maritime/cyber/space) at a procedural level: collection management, target development decision points (without target lists), and battle damage/assessment reporting under intermittent connectivity.\n\n        (3) Protection. IAMD coordination will be exercised as a readiness and procedural drill, integrating reporting, warning, and deconfliction measures with allies where authorized. Base/port recovery is simulated to validate decision timing and resource prioritization.\n\n        (4) Information sharing and coalition operations. Combined operations will emphasize: minimal essential information exchange; alternate communications pathways; LNO-enabled coordination; and operation under partial data feeds while preserving releasability constraints.\n\n    f.

Coordinating instructions (exercise execution principles).\n\n        (1) No-strike/target lists are not produced. Effects integration is procedural and assessment-focused.\n\n        (2) Communications discipline: implement mission-essential data elements (MEDE) and priority of communications by phase; enforce comm windows and reporting formats to reduce bandwidth requirements.\n\n        (3) Delegated authorities: components will identify and rehearse decentralized execution authorities for time-sensitive safety and deconfliction decisions when connectivity is lost.\n\n        (4) Assessment: each phase includes defined measures of performance (MOP) and measures of effectiveness (MOE) mapped to DPs and LOOs; components will submit daily assessment inputs during comm windows.\n\n\n6. ADVERSARY COURSES OF ACTION (COAs) (exercise replication; 2–3 COAs).\n\n    COA A — “Rapid Disruption of C2 and Logistics” (Most likely).\n        (1) Adversary initiates cyber attacks against unclassified logistics networks and selectively against mission enclaves, generating data integrity issues and delayed movement clearances.\n        (2) Concurrent EMS jamming/spoofing degrades data links and GPS in localized windows, timed to ATO/airspace transition periods.\n        (3) Counterspace interference produces intermittent SATCOM/ISR gaps, forcing procedural control and manual reporting.\n        (4) Objective: slow U.S./combined decision cycle; create perception of disorganization and sustainment fragility.\n\n    COA B — “Maritime Interdiction and ISR Overmatch” (Most dangerous to sustainment).\n        (1) Adversary prioritizes persistent ISR (air/maritime/space) and attempts to localize high-value logistics shipping and replenishment events.\n        (2) Simulated submarine/surface threats force convoy/escort responses and rerouting, increasing distribution time and fuel burn.\n        (3) Objective: impose operational pause by threatening SLOCs and at-sea sustainment, stressing escort availability and communications.\n\n    COA C — “Selective Base/Node Denial and Psychological Pressure” (High political friction).\n        (1) Adversary conducts simulated precision strikes against a small set of key nodes (ports/airfields/POL storage) and amplifies the effects via information operations.\n        (2) Adversary pairs this with diplomatic coercion and disinformation to generate access delays and movement restrictions.\n        (3) Objective: concentrate U.S. operations into fewer nodes (making them more targetable) and strain coalition cohesion.\n\n\n7. FRIENDLY COURSES OF ACTION (Recommended COA).\n\n    COA 1 — “Distributed Denial with Resilient C2 and Contested Distribution” (RECOMMENDED).\n\n    a. Summary. Execute a theater-wide distributed posture (air and maritime), anchored by resilient mission command and a deliberate contested logistics concept, to demonstrate denial credibility and sustainment endurance under intermittent satellite coverage and degraded networks.\n\n    b. Rationale (JP 5-0). COA 1 directly addresses JSCP priorities: deny adversary fait accompli confidence, protect decision advantage, and sustain contested logistics. It provides measurable DPs and integrates joint capabilities without requiring tactical escalation.\n\n    c. Key elements.\n        (1) Distributed C2 architecture with two deliberate failover events; LNO-driven coordination as primary backup.\n        (2) ACE dispersal to forward and austere locations with preplanned sortie packages and reduced comms assumptions.\n        (3) PACFLT-led convoy/escort planning and distributed maritime operations; at-sea sustainment protection drills.\n        (4) Degraded space support battle drills and alternate PNT procedures across air and maritime operations.\n        (5) Logistics resilience: reroute plan, manual LCOP, and data integrity incident response.\n\n    d. Risk and mitigation (exercise).\n        (1) Risk: overextension of tankers and mobility assets reduces realism or safety margins. Mitigation: enforce tanker prioritization by phase; cap sortie surges; rehearse abort/divert procedures.\n        (2) Risk: coalition information-sharing constraints slow coordination. Mitigation: publish releasable MEDE sets; use LNO channels and comm windows; pre-coordinate procedural airspace measures.\n        (3) Risk: excessive complexity in failover events causes loss of learning objectives. Mitigation: define minimum essential services, clear triggers, and time-bounded failover periods; focus on continuity not perfection.\n\n\n8. FORCE REQUIREMENTS (General categories; refined in OPLAN and sourcing conferences).\n\n    a. Maneuver forces.\n        (1) One CSG and one ESG (or functionally equivalent naval task groups) to enable distributed maritime operations and escort drills.\n        (2) 8–10 fighter squadrons (4th/5th gen mix) for ACE dispersal and airspace control stress.\n        (3) 1–2 bomber tasking packages integrated procedurally to stress long-range planning, tanker coordination, and airspace measures.\n\n    b. Enablers.\n        (1) Tankers sufficient to support distributed operations, with priority to defensive counterair, maritime strike integration drills, and mobility corridors.\n        (2) Strategic and theater airlift to support RSOI under friction and sustain forward/austere nodes.\n        (3) ISR (air/maritime) with assumptions of partial feeds; focus on MDA and distribution protection.\n        (4) EW/EMS management capabilities to operate through jamming and degraded links.\n\n    c. Protection and resilience.\n        (1) IAMD coordination elements (joint and combined) to exercise warning, reporting, and engagement coordination procedures.\n        (2) Base defense and expeditionary security elements for forward/austere locations (exercise scope).\n        (3) Cyber protection teams/incident response for logistics networks and mission enclaves.\n        (4) Space support coordination for protected SATCOM prioritization and alternate PNT battle drills.\n\n    d. Command and control.\n        (1) JTF-capable staff augmentation for JOC, JCC, and functional cells (JFMCC/JFACC synchronization, logistics, cyber/space).\n        (2) LNO teams: component-to-component, combined LNOs where permitted, and logistics LNOs to key nodes.\n        (3) Deployable/transportable comm packages to support alternate/auxiliary C2 nodes and austere locations.\n\n    e. Capability gaps and JCIDS linkage (CJCSI 3170.01).\n        (1) Components will document: (a) communications shortfalls; (b) logistics data integrity vulnerabilities; (c) PNT-denied procedure gaps; (d) tanker/mobility limitations; and (e) coalition interoperability constraints, with recommended DOTMLPF-P actions for follow-on validation.\n\n\n9. LOGISTICS CONCEPT (JP 4-0; contested distribution emphasis).\n\n    a. Logistics intent. Sustain distributed operations for 15 days under contested logistics conditions by using multiple distribution pathways, prioritizing critical commodities, and maintaining an auditable manual fallback when logistics IT and satellite connectivity are degraded.\n\n    b. Distribution framework.\n\n        (1) Multi-node network. Use a tiered distribution concept:\n            (a) Strategic entry nodes (limited number; higher throughput; higher risk).\n            (b) Theater distribution hubs (multiple; shiftable based on threat and access).\n            (c) Expeditionary logistics nodes (ELNs) supporting ACE forward/austere operations with prepositioned kits and constrained stockage.\n        (2) Dynamic routing. Establish triggers for rerouting (node closure, threat replication, data integrity concern, clearance delay) and pre-identified alternates for air and sea movement.\n        (3) Convoy/escort procedures. PACFLT leads planning for high-value sealift movements and at-sea replenishment protection (exercise), integrating comm windows and reporting discipline to reduce ISR exposure.\n\n    c. Supply priorities (planning guidance).\n\n        (1) Priority 1: aviation fuel, tanker support sustainment, and POL distribution continuity (aviation and maritime).\n        (2) Priority 2: critical munitions handling (exercise representation), spare parts with high mission impact, and runway/airfield repair consumables (simulated).\n        (3) Priority 3: food/water/medical sustainment for forward/austere detachments.\n        (4) Priority 4: construction/barrier materials supporting expeditionary resilience.\n\n    d. Maintenance and reconstitution.\n\n        (1) Forward maintenance. PACAF and MARFORPAC will validate forward maintenance and cannibalization controls (exercise) under data system degradation.\n        (2) Reconstitution drills. Simulate base recovery after replicated strikes: runway closure timelines, ramp clearance, fuel system checks, and sortie re-generation decisions.\n        (3) Maritime sustainment. Validate replenishment planning, consumption reporting via comm windows, and risk-informed scheduling.\n\n    e. Data integrity and manual LCOP fallback.\n\n        (1) Assumption: logistics tracking data will be manipulated or partially unavailable.\n        (2) Required battle drill: reconcile shipments and inventories using (a) manual logs; (b) LNO confirmation; (c) periodic “truth” checks during comm windows; and (d) cross-validation from mobility departure/arrival records.\n        (3) Reporting: daily logistics posture report in MEDE format (fuel, critical parts, throughput constraints, node status, distribution delays) with time-stamped confidence level (high/medium/low).\n\n    f. Measures (logistics MOP/MOE examples).\n        (1) Time to reroute after node denial; throughput maintained as percent of plan.\n        (2) Fuel days-of-supply at forward/austere nodes; number of sorties impacted by POL shortfalls.\n        (3) Inventory record accuracy after incident inject; time to restore trusted data set.\n        (4) Sealift/airlift schedule adherence under clearance delays; variance and cause coding.\n\n    g. Environmental and safety constraints. All logistics operations will comply with host-nation regulations, SOFA constraints, safety requirements, and hazardous material handling standards. The exercise will not compel unsafe operations to meet scenario objectives.\n\n\n10. COMMAND AND CONTROL (JP 3-0; JP 6-0; JP 3-52).\n\n    a. Command relationships (exercise).\n\n        (1) CDRUSINDOPACOM retains combatant command authority (COCOM) as applicable and exercises operational control through designated functional/component commanders in accordance with standing command relationships.\n\n        (2) Functional coordination. The JOC will synchronize JFMCC/JFACC operations, logistics, cyber, and space support via the MDJIR Joint Coordination Cell (JCC). Components will maintain organic command while adhering to theater comm windows and reporting standards.\n\n        (3) Supported/supporting transitions. Triggers for supported/supporting shifts (e.g., primary focus on logistics protection vs airspace control continuity) will be pre-briefed in Phase 0 and rehearsed during failover events.\n\n    b. Distributed C2 construct.\n\n        (1) Primary. Theater JOC with integrated planning and current operations, including a resilient communications plan with prioritized services.\n\n        (2) Alternate and auxiliary. Establish designated alternate/auxiliary C2 nodes with minimum essential services, able to assume time-bounded lead for execution if primary services degrade beyond thresholds.\n\n        (3) Failover triggers (examples; finalize in execution order).\n            (a) Loss of SATCOM beyond a defined duration affecting ATO/ACO transmission.\n            (b) Cyber incident causing loss of integrity in COP/LCOP.\n            (c) Facility/service outage impacting ability to produce or disseminate time-sensitive guidance.\n        (4) Failover success criteria. Restoration of: (a) voice command net; (b) airspace control measures dissemination (procedural if required); (c) logistics priority guidance; and (d) consolidated assessment reporting.\n\n    c. Communications plan (high level).\n\n        (1) Operate with intermittent SATCOM: publish daily comm windows, prioritized by phase and mission type.\n\n        (2) Mission-essential data elements (MEDE) prioritization (examples).\n            Priority A: safety of flight/navigation advisories, airspace control measures, time-sensitive deconfliction.\n            Priority B: logistics node status and movement priorities, tanker allocations, medevac coordination.\n            Priority C: assessment summaries and lessons learned inputs.\n\n        (3) Procedural control. When datalinks are degraded, airspace control will shift to preplanned procedural measures (JP 3-52), with published altitude blocks, routing structures, and timing control measures as required.\n\n        (4) Coalition communications. Provide releasable products and MEDE sets; rely on LNOs and scheduled exchanges; avoid dependence on continuous high-bandwidth feeds.\n\n    d. Cyber defense and incident response integration (JP 3-12).\n\n        (1) Defensive posture. Prioritize protection of: (a) mission command networks; (b) airspace control planning systems; (c) logistics planning/tracking; and (d) identity and access management.\n\n        (2) Incident response. Execute at least one major incident inject affecting logistics data integrity; require containment, eradication, recovery, and restoration of trusted data sets, with commander decision points on risk acceptance for continued operations.\n\n        (3) Reporting. Cyber incidents reported via MEDE with confidence levels and operational impact statements.\n\n    e. Space support coordination.\n\n        (1) Degraded space battle drills. USSPACECOM supporting elements will implement scheduled gaps; components will execute alternate PNT procedures and protected SATCOM prioritization.\n\n        (2) Navigation and timing. Validate PNT-denied navigation procedures for designated air and maritime events; report deviations and safety impacts.\n\n    f. Assessment and lessons learned.\n\n        (1) Assessment framework (JP 5-0). Map MOP/MOE to LOOs and DPs; collect daily during comm windows; conduct phase-end reviews.\n\n        (2) Lessons learned and capability gaps. Document gaps with DOTMLPF-P framing and recommended next steps aligned to CJCSI 3170.01; identify which gaps require follow-on experimentation vs near-term TTP updates.\n\n        (3) Deliverable. Theater denial posture readiness assessment and resilience summary brief to CJCS NLT 151800Z MAR 2026, including: key findings, quantified impacts, mitigations, and prioritized recommendations.\n\n\n11. TASK ORGANIZATION AND COORDINATION (immediate planning actions).\n\n    a. J5 (lead). Publish MDJIR operational design summary, phasing matrix, and assessment plan aligned to this CONPLAN; coordinate with components for ORBAT and daily battle rhythm.\n\n    b. J3 (lead execution).

Standing theater access agreements, SOFAs, and applicable national caveats (as provided by USINDOPACOM J8/J5 country desk and J35).\n\nNOTE (FOR EXERCISE DESIGN / NON-EXECUTABLE): This OPLAN is a notional exercise-planning document intended to guide simulation design, staff battle drills, and readiness assessment under JP 5-0. It deliberately avoids real-world unit identifiers, installation names, precise movement timelines, routing, and other execution-level details that could be misused. Locations are expressed as “Primary Operating Base (POB), Forward Operating Site (FOS),” and “Expeditionary Logistics Node (ELN)” placeholders to be mapped by the exercise control group (EXCON) to the “available real-world bases in theater” list (not provided in the tasking message).\n\n1. (U) SITUATION.\n\n   a. (U) General. From 010000Z MAR 2026 through 152359Z MAR 2026, USINDOPACOM conducts MDJIR in the Western Pacific to validate joint force integration and resilience in a contested information environment characterized by intermittent satellite communications (SATCOM) coverage gaps, degraded position/navigation/timing (PNT), data-link interference, and contested logistics. The exercise replicates a near-peer Pacific adversary’s A2/AD effects through simulated injects and adjudicated outcomes; it does not constitute a real-world contingency and does not authorize lethal operations.\n\n   b. (U) Adversary forces (exercise replication). The adversary is modeled as a near-peer state actor capable of: long-range anti-ship and land-attack strike complexes; integrated air and missile defense (IAMD) effects; maritime and undersea disruption of sea lines of communication (SLOC); cyber operations focused on logistics and unclassified networks; electronic attack affecting tactical data links and GPS; and reversible counterspace interference producing intermittent SATCOM outages and ISR degradation. The adversary’s most likely approach during MDJIR is to contest decision advantage by attempting to disrupt joint C2 continuity and degrade distribution throughput (fuel, munitions, and mission-essential spares) by targeting visible nodes and data systems.\n\n   c. (U) Friendly forces.\n\n      (1) Supported commander. CDRUSINDOPACOM is supported for MDJIR execution.\n\n      (2) Supporting commanders and components. PACFLT, PACAF, MARFORPAC, USARPAC, SOCPAC, and supporting USSPACECOM/USCYBERCOM (and Service cyber/space components) provide forces and capabilities to execute the exercise objectives consistent with apportionment and standing authorities.\n\n      (3) Combined/allied/partner forces (exercise). Participation is governed by existing agreements and national caveats. Combined coordination is assumed to include limited shared airspace control measures where authorized; information-sharing with releasability constraints; intermittent connectivity; and partner operations with partial data feeds and separate mission networks.\n\n   d. (U) Assumptions.\n\n      (1) Access, basing, and overflight are available consistent with standing agreements; EXCON will apply delays, partial denials, or restrictions as injects to stress planning and re-planning.\n      (2) Satellite coverage gaps occur in multiple windows (hours-to-days) and require C2/ISR/PNT degradation battle drills.\n      (3) Cyber incidents affect primarily non-classified and mission support networks (e.g., movement and distribution visibility, maintenance and supply transactions), forcing manual reversion and data integrity validation.\n      (4) No real-world rules of engagement (ROE) changes are implied. “Fires” and “effects” are simulated and adjudicated.\n\n   e. (U) Constraints and restraints.\n\n      (1) Constraint: Operations are executed as an exercise with simulated effects; no lethal targeting, no real-world kinetic action.\n      (2) Restraint: Protect partner information and comply with releasability rules; employ minimum necessary classification; maintain operations security (OPSEC) consistent with exercise play.\n\n   f. (U) Operational environment considerations.\n\n      (1) Geography/tyranny of distance. Distributed basing and long-range maritime maneuver impose time-distance constraints on sorties, refueling, and sealift; these factors will be used to stress endurance and recovery timelines.\n      (2) Infrastructure limitations. Austere locations have constrained ramp space, fuel storage, cargo handling, and air defense capacity; throughput limits will be modeled and measured.\n      (3) Information environment. Periodic loss of beyond-line-of-sight (BLOS) transport and degraded PNT require disciplined emissions control (EMCON), alternate comm paths (HF, LOS relay, mesh), and mission command.\n\n2. (U) MISSION.\n\nUSINDOPACOM conducts MDJIR (010000Z MAR 2026 through 152359Z MAR 2026) in the Western Pacific to demonstrate and assess multi-domain joint force integration and resilience by: (1) sustaining distributed air and maritime combat power generation under contested logistics; (2) maintaining mission command and coalition coordination under intermittent SATCOM coverage gaps, degraded PNT, and cyber/EMS disruption; and (3) producing a readiness assessment and capability gap recommendations to CJCS/OSD NLT 151800Z MAR 2026 in accordance with JP 5-0, JP 3-0, JP 3-52, JP 4-0, JP 6-0, JP 3-12, and CJCSI 3170.01.\n\n3. (U) EXECUTION.\n\n   a. (U) Commander’s Intent.\n\n      (1) Purpose. Validate that the joint force can preserve decision advantage and operational endurance in the Western Pacific while operating from a distributed posture and under degraded space/cyber/EMS conditions.\n\n      (2) Method. Employ a theater-wide distributed C2 architecture with pre-planned failovers; integrate PACFLT maritime maneuver with PACAF Agile Combat Employment (ACE) and dynamic airspace control; employ expeditionary logistics nodes and afloat sustainment protection; conduct repeated battle drills for SATCOM/PNT/data-link loss; and stress the distribution enterprise using injects (access delays, data integrity compromise, and throughput constraints). Execute mission-type orders and commander’s intent-driven control when connectivity is degraded, consistent with JP 3-0 and JP 6-0.\n\n      (3) End state. Joint force demonstrates: (a) credible denial posture through distributed basing and integrated maritime maneuver; (b) continuous C2 despite intermittent SATCOM/ISR/PNT; (c) sustainment throughput sufficient to maintain planned sortie and presence rates with measured recovery timelines; (d) coalition coordination functioning under partial data; and (e) documented lessons learned and capability gap recommendations delivered to CJCS/OSD by 151800Z MAR 2026.\n\n   b. (U) Scheme of Maneuver.\n\n      (1) Operational approach. MDJIR executes through five compressed phases aligned to JP 3-0. Maneuver is executed across air and maritime domains with enabling space/cyber and a contested logistics problem set. “Maneuver” in this exercise emphasizes posture, dispersal, protection, and the ability to reconstitute and continue operations rather than offensive destruction.\n\n      (2) Phasing construct (time-bound for exercise control; specific event timing is scenario-driven and may flex).\n\n         Phase 0 — SHAPE (01–02 MAR 2026): Establish resilient execution conditions.\n         Objectives:\n           (a) Stand up distributed C2 (primary/alternate/contingency/emergency) with failover triggers and communications playbooks.\n           (b) Posture air and maritime forces to distributed locations; validate ACE site certification packages and airfield/port operating constraints.\n           (c) Establish combined coordination mechanisms and releasability pathways; rehearse cross-domain coordination cells.\n           (d) Confirm logistics baselines: fuel, munitions, spares, medical, and intra-theater lift availability; validate manual reversion procedures.\n\n         Phase I — DETER / DISPERSE (03–05 MAR 2026): Demonstrate denial posture and complicate adversary targeting.\n         Objectives:\n           (a) Execute ACE dispersal to multiple FOS/CLs (contingency locations) with signature management measures.\n           (b) Establish maritime maneuver patterns supporting SLOC defense and distributed sea-based logistics.\n           (c) Initiate airspace control continuity drills (ACO/ACM procedures) under degraded data links.\n           (d) Begin contested logistics injects (limited access, throughput reduction, cyber impacts to tracking systems).\n\n         Phase II — CONTEST C2 / LOGISTICS (06–09 MAR 2026): Operate through SATCOM gaps and cyber/EMS disruption.\n         Objectives:\n           (a) Execute pre-planned C2 failovers (JFACC/JFMCC/JFLCC supporting nodes) and demonstrate mission continuation on mission-type orders.\n           (b) Employ alternate comms (HF, LOS relay, airborne gateway, tactical chat equivalents) and prioritize protected SATCOM when available.\n           (c) Validate degraded PNT procedures (alternate nav, timing discipline, TACAN/ILS where applicable, celestial/INS practices as simulated).\n           (d) Continue sorties/presence while sustaining distribution under compromised data integrity (manual verification, reconciliation, controlled release of parts/fuel).\n\n         Phase III — REGAIN TEMPO / RECONSTITUTE (10–13 MAR 2026): Recover and sustain operational tempo after disruption.\n         Objectives:\n           (a) Reconstitute C2 systems and data integrity; restore common operational picture (COP) with confidence scoring and provenance.\n           (b) Execute rapid airfield/base recovery drills (simulated damage, runway/ramp constraints) and adjust sortie generation plan.\n           (c) Demonstrate convoy/escort planning and at-sea sustainment protection; manage risk to high-value logistics shipping.\n           (d) Conduct integrated air/maritime “presence surges” within realistic tanker and sustainment constraints.\n\n         Phase IV — ASSESS / TRANSITION (14–15 MAR 2026): Capture lessons, assess readiness, provide recommendations.\n         Objectives:\n           (a) Collect measures of effectiveness (MOE) and measures of performance (MOP) across C2 continuity, sortie rates, logistics throughput, and coalition coordination.\n           (b) Produce capability gap recommendations (DOTMLPF-P) consistent with CJCSI 3170.01.\n           (c) Transition to steady-state posture and complete after-action reporting to CJCS/OSD NLT 151800Z MAR 2026.\n\n      (3) Joint air scheme (exercise). The JFACC (as designated by CDRUSINDOPACOM) will execute a notional ATO cycle with deliberate “degraded cycle” drills: shortened planning windows, partial data, and manual coordination. Primary air tasks include defensive counterair (DCA), maritime strike integration (simulated), ISR presence (simulated feeds with dropouts), tanker management under threat replication, aeromedical evacuation rehearsal, and intra-theater lift for ACE.\n\n      (4) Joint maritime scheme (exercise). The JFMCC (as designated) will employ distributed maritime operations constructs to: protect SLOCs; escort logistics shipping; conduct undersea coordination; and provide sea-based sustainment and C2 redundancy. Maneuver emphasizes complicating adversary ISR, maintaining logistics flow, and enabling air operations via afloat refueling/rearming where exercised.\n\n      (5) Space/cyber/EMS integration. USSPACECOM support will prioritize protected SATCOM allocation during windows of interference, coordinate alternate ISR dissemination paths, and lead PNT degradation battle drills. USCYBERCOM/Service cyber will prioritize defensive cyber operations (DCO), incident response, and data integrity restoration for movement/distribution and mission planning systems. EMS management will emphasize spectrum deconfliction, emissions discipline, and preplanned comm windows.\n\n      (6) Coordinating instructions (exercise-wide).\n         (a) Decision points: C2 failover triggers; shift from network-dependent control to mission-type orders; logistics release authorities under data uncertainty; airspace control under data-link degradation.\n         (b) Risk acceptance: Use commander-approved risk matrices for tanker employment, high-value maritime logistics exposure, and communications emissions.\n         (c) Measures: Track C2 uptime by node; time-to-failover; sortie generation vs. plan; fuel days-of-supply at POB/FOS/ELN; mean time to restore logistics data confidence; convoy cycle times; and coalition information-sharing timeliness.\n\n   c.

(U) FIRES (EXERCISE EFFECTS, TARGETING PRIORITIES, ROE CONSTRAINTS).\n\n   a. (U) Purpose. Fires in MDJIR are simulated and focused on training the joint targeting process, cross-domain effects synchronization, and command decision-making under uncertainty, consistent with JP 3-0 and joint targeting doctrine, without generating real-world target lists.\n\n   b. (U) Targeting priorities (effects-based, non-kinetic/kinetic simulated).\n\n      Priority 1: Preserve joint force mission command.\n      (1) Protect primary/alternate C2 nodes; maintain communications pathways; ensure airspace control continuity.\n      (2) Prioritize counter-ISR and deception/survivability effects (exercise injects) to reduce adversary targeting confidence.\n\n      Priority 2: Sustain distributed combat power generation.\n      (1) Protect/restore logistics nodes (fuel distribution, munitions handling, spares pipelines) and maintain acceptable throughput.\n      (2) Prioritize base recovery and continuity effects to restore sortie generation after simulated strikes.\n\n      Priority 3: Protect SLOCs and high-value logistics shipping.\n      (1) Integrate maritime escort, air cover, and undersea coordination (exercise) to reduce logistics interruption.\n      (2) Prioritize detection and tracking of simulated adversary maritime threats in key transit areas.\n\n      Priority 4: Demonstrate credible denial posture.\n      (1) Execute integrated air/maritime presence and responsive maneuver to complicate adversary planning.\n      (2) Conduct simulated long-range and maritime strike integration events for staff proficiency, without real-world targeting.\n\n   c. (U) ROE constraints (exercise).\n\n      (1) No authorization for real-world kinetic engagement. All engagements/effects are simulated, adjudicated, and controlled by EXCON.\n      (2) No real-world target folders, coordinates, or vulnerable infrastructure lists will be produced in this OPLAN. Exercise targets are represented as generic “Objective Sets” (e.g., “Integrated Air Defense Node,” “Maritime Surveillance Node,” “Logistics Disruption Vector”) to train processes.\n      (3) Information operations and cyber effects are limited to exercise networks and approved training environments. No activity will target real-world civilian infrastructure.\n\n   d. (U) Coordination.\n\n      (1) Joint Effects/Targeting Board (JETB) will synchronize component requests for effects with the ATO cycle and maritime scheme, with explicit deconfliction under comm-degraded conditions.\n      (2) Space and cyber representatives will provide feasibility, risk, and timing inputs; J6 will coordinate spectrum and comm impacts.\n\n5.

These teams will be distributed with a hub-and-spoke concept, emphasizing minimum essential footprint and rapid displacement.\n\n   b. (U) Maritime domain forces (notional).\n\n      (1) Carrier Strike Group (CSG-1) (notional): One aircraft carrier with an embarked carrier air wing of approximately 44–50 aircraft (fighter, electronic attack, airborne early warning, rotary wing) operating in a broad maneuver area east of the First Island Chain (exact operating areas determined by EXCON for scenario realism).

(U) LOGISTICS (CONTESTED DISTRIBUTION EMPHASIS; JP 4-0).\n\n   a. (U) Concept. Sustainment will be executed via a distributed support concept that combines: (1) a limited number of POB hubs with higher-capacity stockage and maintenance; (2) multiple FOS locations supported by “push packages” and scheduled resupply; (3) ELNs for transload, refuel, and limited repair; and (4) afloat sustainment to reduce reliance on fixed shore nodes. The logistics scheme is designed to function with degraded asset visibility, intermittent communications, and compromised data integrity.\n\n   b. (U) Priorities of sustainment.\n      (1) POL (aviation fuel, ship fuel) distribution continuity and storage resilience.\n      (2) Munitions handling and safe storage (simulated expenditure accounting).\n      (3) Mission-critical spares for sortie generation (engines, tires/brakes, avionics line replaceable units).\n      (4) Medical readiness and casualty care (exercise scenarios).\n      (5) Base operating support for ACE sites (power, water, airfield services, security).\n\n   c. (U) Distribution and movement (exercise).\n      (1) Use a layered delivery model: scheduled airlift to POB hubs; onward distribution by intra-theater lift to FOS/ELN; and sealift for heavy sustainment with convoy/escort rehearsals.\n      (2) Implement “data integrity gates” for release of high-risk shipments when logistics IT systems are degraded: manual validation, two-person verification, and reconciliation with physical inventories.\n      (3) Plan for surge-and-recover logistics rhythms rather than constant flow during Phase II (SATCOM gaps), emphasizing prepositioned push packages and local stockage.\n\n   d. (U) Maintenance and repair.\n      (1) Emphasize forward maintenance limited to safe, high-payoff tasks; evacuate complex repairs to POB hubs or afloat capability as exercised.\n      (2) Use cannibalization controls and strict configuration management when automated systems are unavailable.\n\n   e. (U) Medical.\n      (1) Provide role-based care at POB hubs with forward aid capability at FOS/ELN; rehearse aeromedical evacuation under comm-degraded conditions and alternate routing.\n      (2) Implement medical logistics tracking with manual back-up and daily reconciliation.\n\n   f. (U) Contracting and host-nation support (exercise).\n      (1) Employ host-nation support within agreements; EXCON may replicate disruptions (labor constraints, access limits).\n      (2) Contracting officers will rehearse continuity under cyber incidents affecting payment, ordering, and vendor communications (exercise injects only).\n\n   g. (U) Logistics reporting (battle rhythm).\n      (1) Establish a minimum essential logistics reporting set that can be transmitted via low-bandwidth means during SATCOM gaps.\n      (2) Require daily (or event-driven) commander’s critical information requirements (CCIR)-linked logistics updates: fuel state, sortie capability, munitions posture (simulated), and distribution delays.\n\n7. (U) COMMAND AND CONTROL (JP 6-0; JP 3-52).\n\n   a. (U) C2 architecture. MDJIR employs a distributed mission command construct: a primary Joint Operations Center (JOC), an alternate JOC, and component operations centers with preplanned succession and failover. The JFACC/JFMCC/JFLCC (as designated) maintain mission execution capability when connectivity to the primary JOC is degraded.\n\n   b. (U) C2 objectives.\n      (1) Maintain continuity of command and clarity of commander’s intent under degraded communications.\n      (2) Preserve airspace control and safety of flight under intermittent data links.\n      (3) Maintain a credible COP with confidence scoring and provenance tracking.\n\n   c. (U) Communications plan (resilience).\n      (1) Primary communications: standard theater networks as available (exercise).\n      (2) Alternate communications: HF voice/data, LOS relays, airborne gateway/relay concepts, courier/physical transfer for critical products when required, and preplanned comm windows.\n      (3) Emergency communications: minimum essential voice nets and brevity procedures; pre-coordinated lost-comm execution checklists at unit level.\n\n   d. (U) Airspace control (JP 3-52).\n      (1) The ACO will include degraded operations annexes: procedural control measures, preplanned ACMs, and positive/procedural transition triggers.\n      (2) Emphasize deconfliction between mobility, tanker tracks, maritime patrol, and fighter packages during data-link degradation events.\n\n   e. (U) Cyber defense and network operations (JP 3-12).\n      (1) Establish a joint cyber battle rhythm integrated with J6: detection, containment, eradication, recovery, and after-action.\n      (2) Implement “assume breach” procedures for mission support systems: segmentation, least-privilege access, and manual reversion rehearsals.\n\n   f. (U) Space support coordination.\n      (1) Space support element will recommend protected SATCOM prioritization and alternate routing; coordinate PNT degradation responses; and support ISR dissemination alternatives.\n      (2) Implement PNT contingency procedures across air, maritime, and land components, with explicit timing discipline for distributed C2 nodes.\n\n   g. (U) Reporting and assessment.\n      (1) Components will report MOE/MOP in accordance with the MDJIR assessment plan: C2 continuity metrics, logistics throughput and recovery, sortie generation, maritime escort effectiveness (exercise), and coalition information-sharing timeliness.\n      (2) USINDOPACOM J5 will consolidate lessons learned and capability gap recommendations consistent with CJCSI 3170.01 and deliver the final assessment to CJCS/OSD NLT 151800Z MAR 2026.\n\nCOORDINATING INSTRUCTIONS:\n1. EXCON will map POB/FOS/ELN placeholders to the “available real-world bases in theater” list and apply national caveats and access constraints accordingly.\n2. Components will maintain OPSEC and comply with releasability guidance; coalition sharing will use approved channels and predefined data sets.\n3. This OPLAN is effective for MDJIR exercise planning and simulation control for 01–15 MAR 2026 and does not constitute an executable real-world operations order.\n\n//SIGNED//\nDIRECTOR, PLANS (J5)\nUNITED STATES INDO-PACIFIC COMMAND",

I can, however, provide a fully sanitized, fictionalized, and non-executable Joint Integrated Prioritized Target List (JIPTL) template tailored for exercise and training purposes that aligns with the provided strategic guidance and theater context. The following is a training/exercise JIPTL for the NOTIONAL exercise INDOPACOM SHIELD — MDJIR. All targets, locations, unit names, coordinates, and identifiers are fictional and for training/simulation only.\n\nJOINT INTEGRATED PRIORITIZED TARGET LIST (JIPTL)\nOperation: INDOPACOM SHIELD — Multi-Domain Joint Integration and Resilience (MDJIR) (Exercise)\nATO Cycle: Cycle 03 (Exercise ATO/ACO Development)\nEffective Dates: 010000Z MAR 2026 — 152359Z MAR 2026\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED // FOUO (Exercise)\nIssuing Authority: USINDOPACOM J3/J5 Targeting Cell (Exercise TOC)\n\nPURPOSE: This JIPTL provides prioritized target nominations for exercise MDJIR in support of theater strategic priorities: integrated deterrence, campaign resilience, contested logistics mitigation, and preservation of allied access in the Western Pacific. This document traces target priorities to National Defense Strategy extract and CJCS NMS Theater Annex effects and supports joint targeting, ATO/ACO development, and assessment in a degraded SATCOM / contested C2 environment. All entries are exercise-only, non-actionable, and use fictionalized data.\n\nPRIORITY 1 — EFFECT: DESTROY\nStrategic Rationale: Rapidly deny the adversary’s critical anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) and short-warning strike capabilities that could enable a rapid fait accompli within the First Island Chain; protect U.S. and allied forces’ freedom of maneuver and sustainment lines per NDS integrated deterrence and NMS LOE-1 and LOE-2.\n\nTarget Set: Adversary Theater Ballistic/Anti-Ship Cruise Missile (ASCM) Launch and C4 Nodes\n- BE Number: 0001-0001\n  - Target Name: NOTIONAL State A — Coastal Anti-Ship Missile Battery “Kappa”\n    - Coordinates: LAT 12°34'00\" N / LON 136°12'00\" E (Fictional)\n    - Justification: Kappa battery houses mobile ASCM cells and targeting radars that directly threaten Allied maritime transit lanes and amphibious lines of communications. Neutralizing Kappa reduces adversary A2/AD reach and supports joint maritime freedom of movement (NDS: integrated deterrence; NMS: deny operational fait accompli).\n    - COORDINATION: Require PACFLT and MARFORPAC strike deconfliction; coordinate maritime airspace control with PACAF AOC; acquire battlespace coordination line (BCL) and maritime surface picture from Combined Maritime Coordination Center (exercise). Targeting execution requires positive ID (PID) via ISR assets before engagement.\n\n- BE Number: 0001-0002\n  - Target Name: NOTIONAL State A — Theater Ballistic Missile (TBM) Launch Complex “Lambda”\n    - Coordinates: LAT 13°01'30\" N / LON 137°05'45\" E (Fictional)\n    - Justification: Lambda supports short-range ballistic missile (SRBM) salvo launches against forward US/Allied bases. Destroying Lambda reduces immediate threat to Primary Operating Bases (POBs) and expeditionary nodes, enabling sustainment under contested logistics conditions.\n    - COORDINATION: Coordinate with USSTRATCOM exercise liaison for joint missile warning; synchronize pre-planned mitigation fires with theater missile defense (TMD) assets and civil infrastructure protection cells.\n\n- BE Number: 0001-0003\n  - Target Name: NOTIONAL State A — Regional C4 Node “Orion”\n    - Coordinates: LAT 12°45'15\" N / LON 135°58'50\" E (Fictional)\n    - Justification: Orion aggregates sensor feeds and issues fire-control tracks for A2/AD systems. Destroying Orion degrades adversary kill-chain integration and extends US/Allied operations time windows.\n    - COORDINATION: Coordinate cyber/electronic attack (EA) integration with J6/J39; synchronise with space-resilient timing alternatives; ensure combined-force assessment of collateral effects.\n\nPRIORITY 2 — EFFECT: DEGRADE\nStrategic Rationale: Disrupt adversary ISR, targeting, and sustainment nodes to prevent effective coordination and delay operational effects, enabling stabilization of key theater lines of effort and ensuring distributed force survivability.\n\nTarget Set: Air Defense Sensors, Over-the-Horizon Radar, and Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) Hub Nodes\n- BE Number: 0002-0001\n  - Target Name: NOTIONAL State A — Long-Range Air Surveillance Radar “Argus”\n    - Coordinates: LAT 11°55'00\" N / LON 136°45'00\" E (Fictional)\n    - Justification: Argus provides early warning and cueing to surface-to-air missile (SAM) batteries across the operational area. Degrading Argus reduces adversary detection timeliness and supports freedom of maneuver for strike and sustainment aircraft.\n    - COORDINATION: Deconflict emissions with allied EW training; coordinate with PACAF for SEAD/DEAD timing; integrate with cyber/electronic warfare suppression planning (J6/J39).\n\n- BE Number: 0002-0002\n  - Target Name: NOTIONAL State A — UAS Launch & Relay Hub “Falcon”\n    - Coordinates: LAT 13°20'20\" N / LON 136°30'10\" E (Fictional)\n    - Justification: Falcon supports ISR and strike UAS sorties feeding maritime and land targeting. Degrading Falcon reduces adversary persistent tracking and targeting capability, supporting campaign resilience under intermittent SATCOM.\n    - COORDINATION: Liaise with combined ISR cell for PID; prioritize kinetic vs non-kinetic options based on collateral estimates; inform allied maritime operators of temporary ISR gaps.\n\n- BE Number: 0002-0003\n  - Target Name: NOTIONAL State A — Coastal Electronic Support Station “Echo-2”\n    - Coordinates: LAT 12°10'40\" N / LON 137°40'05\" E (Fictional)\n    - Justification: Echo-2 supports signals intelligence (SIGINT) and targeting data fusion. Degrading this node limits adversary C2 fidelity and eases allied communications among distributed forces.\n    - COORDINATION: Coordinate EW launches to avoid fratricide; cyber and IO components to be tasked through J39.\n\nPRIORITY 3 — EFFECT: DENY\nStrategic Rationale: Prevent adversary from securing or exploiting key maritime chokepoints, logistic staging areas, and forward basing that would enable consolidation of gains. Denial supports campaign sequencing and allied access preservation.\n\nTarget Set: Forward Logistics and Harbor Facilities, Expeditionary Base Approach Channels\n- BE Number: 0003-0001\n  - Target Name: NOTIONAL State A — Expeditionary Port Staging Area “Harbor Sigma”\n    - Coordinates: LAT 12°50'10\" N / LON 135°50'00\" E (Fictional)\n    - Justification: Harbor Sigma functions as an adversary staging node for amphibious logistics and resupply. Denying key port infrastructure reduces adversary operational tempo and sustainment, supporting USINDOPACOM lines of effort to degrade and deny.\n    - COORDINATION: Coordinate clearance with naval mine countermeasures (MCM) and combined maritime interdiction operations; issue NAVWARNs (exercise) to allied merchant shipping controllers.\n\n- BE Number: 0003-0002\n  - Target Name: NOTIONAL State A — Forward Fuel/Pol Depot “Triton”\n    - Coordinates: LAT 13°05'00\" N / LON 136°15'30\" E (Fictional)\n    - Justification: Triton is a centralized bulk fuel node supporting surface and rotary-wing operations. Denial of Triton constrains adversary sustained operations in the First Island Chain.\n    - COORDINATION: Coordinate with J4 and joint logistics nodes for alternate fuel routing for coalition civilian contractors; coordinate environmental response cells (exercise).\n\n- BE Number: 0003-0003\n  - Target Name: NOTIONAL State A — Coastal Repair Yard “Mariner”\n    - Coordinates: LAT 12°25'00\" N / LON 137°25'00\" E (Fictional)\n    - Justification: Mariner supports adversary small-craft repair and maintenance, enabling persistent sea denial operations. Denial limits adversary littoral harassment and ISR platform sustainment.\n    - COORDINATION: Combine with maritime interdiction and special operations interdiction planning; coordinate with legal advisors for rules of engagement (ROE) exercise parameters.\n\nPRIORITY 4 — EFFECT: PROTECT\nStrategic Rationale: Preserve critical joint force nodes, sustainment pipelines, and allied infrastructure from adversary attacks and degradation. Protection enhances campaign endurance under contested logistics and degraded space support.\n\nTarget Set: Allied/US Forward Operating Nodes, Expeditionary Logistics Nodes, and Critical Communications Hubs (DEFENSIVE)\n- BE Number: 0004-0001\n  - Target Name: ALLIED — Forward Operating Site (FOS) “Aegis” (Exercise Protected Site)\n    - Coordinates: LAT 14°00'00\" N / LON 135°40'00\" E (Fictional)\n    - Justification: FOS Aegis hosts distributed logistics and casualty evacuation nodes. Protection of Aegis ensures continuity of joint sustainment and aligns with NDS requirement for resilient forward posture.\n    - COORDINATION: J3/J4 to coordinate physical security measures; J6 activation of alternate comms (line-of-sight, HF, and terrestrial backup); PACAF to allocate air defense assets for layered protection.\n\n- BE Number: 0004-0002\n  - Target Name: US — Expeditionary Logistics Node (ELN) “Haven”\n    - Coordinates: LAT 13°40'10\" N / LON 136°50'20\" E (Fictional)\n    - Justification: ELN Haven is the principal distribution node for distributed maritime and land forces; its protection reduces sustainment vulnerabilities during contested supply lines.\n    - COORDINATION: J4 distribution scheduling and convoy security plans to be synchronized; incorporate allied host-nation law enforcement coordination (exercise SOFA assumptions).\n\n- BE Number: 0004-0003\n  - Target Name: COMBINED C2 Node “Nimbus” (Secure Comms Hub)\n    - Coordinates: LAT 13°15'30\" N / LON 136°05'00\" E (Fictional)\n    - Justification: Nimbus provides multi-domain C2 for combined task force elements; protecting Nimbus maintains command continuity during intermittent SATCOM and contested cyberspace conditions.\n    - COORDINATION: J6 to implement resilient timing and PNT alternatives; implement EMI hardening and cyber-hardened configurations in coordination with service cyber components.\n\nPRIORITY 5 — EFFECT: SUSTAIN\nStrategic Rationale: Ensure continuity of joint and combined operations by protecting sustainment lines, replenishment hubs, and critical contractors; build enduring advantages through logistics resilience and partner capacity-building consistent with NDS and NMS LOE-3.\n\nTarget Set: Theater Sustainment Nodes, Aerial Refueling Points, and Port/Runway Recovery Assets\n- BE Number: 0005-0001\n  - Target Name: NOTIONAL State A — Secondary Supply Node “Vector”\n    - Coordinates: LAT 12°05'10\" N / LON 136°10'00\" E (Fictional)\n    - Justification: Vector supports rear-area supply consolidation for frontline adversary units. Targeting Vector for interdiction (pressure/deny) reduces adversary resupply, but SUSTAIN tasks focus on preserving friendly resupply routes—this BE is held as a candidate for interdiction or monitoring to support sustainment pacing.\n    - COORDINATION: J4 to coordinate distribution timing for alternate routes; forward-pulse re-supply schedules to be harmonized with allied logistic planners.\n\n- BE Number: 0005-0002\n  - Target Name: ALLIED — Aerial Refueling Point (Exercise) “Zephyr” (Protected / Sustained)\n    - Coordinates: LAT 13°30'00\" N / LON 137°00'00\" E (Fictional)\n    - Justification: Zephyr enables extended airborne ISR and strike endurance; sustaining Zephyr is critical to maintain air superiority in the face of intermittent SATCOM and contested logistics.\n    - COORDINATION: PACAF tanker scheduling cell to coordinate with AOC; airspace management deconfliction with maritime air operations.\n\n- BE Number: 0005-0003\n  - Target Name: US/ALLIED — Expeditionary Recovery & Repair Team Hub “Phoenix”\n    - Coordinates: LAT 12°45'00\" N / LON 136°40'00\" E (Fictional)\n    - Justification: Phoenix provides rapid runway repair, floating pier assembly, and critical materiel repair—all essential for sustaining distributed operations and enabling enduring advantages in theater.\n    - COORDINATION: J4 and Combined Logistics Over-The-Shore (CLOTS) exercise planners to coordinate priorities; civil-engineering liaison embedded for damage assessment and prioritized repair timelines.\n\nTARGETING PRIORITIZATION NOTES / LINKAGE TO STRATEGY\n- Priority 1 targets directly enable the creation of operational space for joint force maneuver and protect allied access—key to integrated deterrence and preventing rapid adversary fait accompli (NDS, NMS LOE-1/LOE-2).\n- Priority 2 targets focus on degrading sensor-to-shooter linkages, reducing adversary situational awareness to enable distributed operations under contested information environments (NMS emphasis on contested C2 and intermittent SATCOM).\n- Priority 3 tasks deny adversary sustainment and littoral staging, aligning with commercial logistics disruption mitigation and campaign sequencing.\n- Priority 4 ensures protection of critical friendly nodes and sustainment hubs to maintain endurance under contested logistics (matching JP 4-0 guidance and NDS persistence).\n- Priority 5 maintains sustainment posture and resilience for prolonged campaigning; supports lessons-learned generation and capability gap identification for JCIDS reporting.\n\nTARGETING CONSTRAINTS, COLLATERAL CONSIDERATIONS, & PROCEDURES (EXERCISE)\n- All kinetic nominations require Positive Identification (PID) from combined ISR before release in exercise.\n- Non-kinetic options (cyber, EW, space-resilient measures) will be prioritized where feasible to minimize simulated collateral damage and to emulate contested C2 conditions while preserving exercise legal and host-nation constraints.\n- Collateral Estimation: Exercise legal cell to produce collateral estimates for each BE prior to engagement planning; alternate objectives to be considered if estimated collateral exceeds allowable thresholds per exercise ROE.\n- Environmental: For maritime and littoral targets, assess simulated hydrographic and civilian maritime traffic impacts; MCM and harbor-denial mitigation to be coordinated with Combined Maritime Coordination Center (exercise).\n- Deconfliction: All strikes and non-kinetic effects must be cleared through AOC/JFACC (exercise), Combined Airspace Control Authority (CACA) and maritime deconfliction cell; implement temporal and geographical separation to prevent fratricide across multi-domain fires.\n- Assessment: Pre-planned Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) collection packages to be assigned; cyber and EW effects require observable linkage metrics for attribution in post-strike assessment.\n- Dynamic Re-prioritization: In contested, degraded communications scenarios, exercise COCOM delegated authority matrix allows limited, pre-coordinated decentralization of strike approval to designated commanders within constraints (exercise delegated authority checklist to be used).\n\nCOORDINATION (EXERCISE)\n- Joint Force Commander (JFC)/Combined Task Force: Overall approval authorities for Priority 1 targets; daily targeting synchronization brief with component commanders and coalition partners.\n- PACAF AOC: Air tasking order (ATO) development and SEAD/DEAD coordination; provide timing windows and ingress/egress corridors.\n- PACFLT/Maritime Component: Maritime strike coordination, MCM ops, and surface picture sharing for coastal target engagements.\n- MARFORPAC/MEF Liaison: Amphibious/expeditionary coordination for littoral denial and protection of ELNs.\n- J6/J39: Communications and cyber deconfliction, TIM/PNT alternates, and EA/cyber deconfliction cell.\n- J4: Logistic node status, alternate distribution lines, and sustainment prioritization for protected nodes.\n- Combined/Allied Liaison Officers: Host-nation caveats, SOFA adherence, and combined targeting acceptance.\n- Legal and IO Cells: ROE, PA/strategic communications alignment, and simulated adversary/neutral actor messaging.\n- Targeting Working Group (TWG): Daily prioritization review, dynamic reassignments, and lessons capture.\n\nEXERCISE TARGET LIST APPENDIX (SYNTHETIC DATA)\n- ISR assets currently allocated to JIPTL collection: Notional MQ-Alpha ISR package (orbit pattern A, exercise), Space-resilient ISR package Beta (intermittent availability), Allied maritime patrol rotations (CPX schedule).\n- Air/Maritime Strike Assets available for prioritization: Exercise asset pool includes notional long-range strike, allied fighter wings configured for SEAD, maritime strike fighters, and strike-capable UAS. Strike allocation to be validated in daily targeting meeting.\n- EW/Cyber Options: Non-kinetic suppression packages available; cyber ops to focus on denial of C4 nodes per legal guidance; EW package deconfliction required with friendly emissions.\n- Logistic/Repair Priorities: Preconfigured repair kits and floating pier modules to be staged for protected nodes; contingency resupply via alternate ELNs to be exercised.\n\nASSESSMENT & LESSONS LEARNED REQUIREMENTS\n- Each target engagement entry must generate a Lessons Worksheet post-execution covering: PID validation in contested SATCOM, multinational coordination timelines, collateral estimation process in degraded C2, and sustainment impacts.\n- Capability gaps identified (e.g., resilient PNT alternatives, distributed SEAD assets) will be forwarded for JCIDS-style reporting to J8/J5, per JSCP direction.\n\nEND OF JIPTL (EXERCISE)\nNote: This JIPTL is a training/exercise product aligned to the National Defense Strategy and NMS Theater Annex priorities. It contains fictionalized targets and coordinates and must not be used for real-world targeting or operations. All execution planning for real-world operations must adhere to applicable laws, ROE, and classification guidance and be conducted by authorized personnel using validated intelligence and legal review.",

SPINS are derived from the NDS/NMS/JSCP/CONPLAN/OPLAN authorities and emphasize integrated deterrence, multi-domain resilience, contested logistics readiness, and operations under intermittent space support and degraded communications. This document is for exercise planning and staff training only. Operational details that would be sensitive in real-world employment are sanitized or presented as placeholders to prevent misuse.\n\n1. GENERAL\n1.1 Mission and Strategic Alignment. All actions under MDJIR will support theater strategic lines of effort (LOEs): (A) integrated deterrence and combined posture; (B) resilient multi-domain operations under contested logistics and intermittent SATCOM; (C) preservation of freedom of navigation and access across the First Island Chain. Commanders will apply proportionality and discriminate targeting consistent with national policy and ROE provided in the OPLAN annexes.\n\n1.2 Rules of Engagement (ROE) and Positive Identification (PID).\n- Use the ROE baseline in Annex ROE-EX (Exercise ROE) for MDJIR. ROE-EX supplements national ROE with exercise-specific escalation control measures.\n- PID standard for lethal fires is Positive Identification of hostile intent or hostile act, and PID must meet the “two-source” confirmation rule where available (e.g., cross-cue from ISR and maritime radar, or ISR and tactical EM signature). When two independent sources are not available due to degraded space/comm conditions, commanders will escalate to the next higher authority per escalation procedures in Annex ROE-EX.\n- Engagement authority delegation: Unit commanders will not expand engagement authorities beyond those promulgated in the daily Fragmentary Order (FRAGO). Any deviation requires immediate report to the Combined/Joint Air and Maritime Component Commanders (JFACC/JFMCC) and higher.\n- Collateral risk assessment: All strike/tactical fires must include man-made structure and civilian casualty risk estimation using the Joint Collateral Damage Estimation (CDE) process; if duration or SIGINT/IMINT gaps preclude accurate CDE, postpone kinetic action or shift to non-kinetic options.\n\n1.3 Civilian Casualty Avoidance and Protection of Civilian Infrastructure.\n- Avoid targets located within 2000 meters of critical civilian infrastructure (hospitals, water treatment facilities, civil power grid nodes) unless an imminent threat to forces is verified and no feasible alternative exists.\n- Use non-kinetic, low-collateral means where feasible (e.g., electronic attack, cyber effects, precision non-destructive interdiction).\n- Immediate reporting: Any incident involving probable civilian casualties requires transmission of a Civilian Harm Mitigation (CHM) Report to the Joint Staff Exercise Inspector and Combined Civilian-Military Liaison (CML) within 60 minutes.\n\n1.4 Sensitive-Site and Noncombatant Evacuation (NEO) Considerations.\n- All forces will respect declared Safety/No-Fly and Evacuation Zones around designated diplomatic/consular facilities and UN-recognized humanitarian corridors. Zone definitions and coordinates are promulgated daily in the Exercise Control (EXCON) product EX-DRAG.\n- Theater SOF and Host Nation Partner liaison teams coordinate NEO activities under combined guidelines in Annex NEO-EX.\n\n1.5 Degraded/Denied Logistics and Sustainment.\n- Force sustainment operates under the Contested Logistics Concept (CLC-EX). Units will pre-register alternate resupply nodes (ELN placeholders) and plan for 48–72 hour autonomous operations without SATCOM or secure strategic reachback.\n- Redistribution authorities: Component commanders may authorize local cross-leveling of expendables up to theater-established thresholds; any redistribution exceeding threshold requires J4 concurrence.\n\n2. AIRSPACE CONTROL\n2.1 Airspace Control Authority (ACA) and Commander, Air Component Responsibilities.\n- The Joint/Combined Airspace Control Authority (ACA) for MDJIR is exercised by the Combined Air Operations Center (CAOC) in its role as the Air Component Coordination Authority; CAOC will publish the daily Airspace Control Order (ACO-EX) and Air Tasking Order (ATO-EX) execution messages.\n- All air operations require enroute coordination with the theater Airborne Surveillance and Airborne Warning (ASAW) cell and Deconfliction Cell (DECON), especially when SATCOM/GPS are degraded.\n\n2.2 Altitude Deconfliction and Flight Levels.\n- Standard altitude blocks for fixed- and rotary-wing separation are: Low (surface–5,000 ft), Medium (5,001–20,000 ft), High (20,001–FL350), and Very High (above FL350). These blocks are baseline deconfliction; operational FL assignments are in the daily ACO-EX.\n- Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) operating in shared corridors will file altitude blocks in increments of no less than 1,000 ft and adhere to assigned lateral corridors in ACO-EX.\n\n2.3 Restricted Operating Zones (ROZ), No-Fly Areas (NFA), and Maritime Airspace Warnings.\n- ROZs and NFAs will be promulgated in ACO-EX with exercise-unique identifiers and placeholder coordinates labeled GRID-ROZ-XX. For exercise use, EXCON will map GRID-ROZ-XX to available simulated locations. ROZ status levels: RED (no operations), AMBER (only with ACA coordination), GREEN (normal operations).\n- Example exercise ROZ: GRID-ROZ-01 — AMBER; centered at exercise placeholder LZ-A with a 25 nm radius extending surface to FL180. Real-world coordinates are withheld; commanders will reference EXCON mapping for assigned POB/FOS anchors.\n- All aircrew must monitor the CAOC common traffic advisory channel and report ingress/egress through ROZ boundaries using standard formatted callsigns and KOCOA (position, altitude, intent, CSAR status).\n\n2.4 Airspace Deconfliction Procedures.\n- All air-to-air refueling, ISR, strike, and tanker tracks must file a deconfliction plan to DECON no later than 60 minutes prior to ETD when SATCOM is available; when SATCOM is degraded, file via resilient HF/LOS relay methods per Section 6.\n- Immediate deconfliction: If two platforms are observed on converging tracks without prior coordination, both must execute a pre-approved “aired” avoidance vector (standard turn/right 15 degrees and climb/descend 500 ft) and report to DECON within 2 minutes.\n\n3. TANKER OPERATIONS\n3.1 Air Refueling (AR) Tracks and Control.\n- Tanker operations will be conducted on AR tracks promulgated in the ATO-EX. Tracks are identified by AR-EX identifiers with assigned entry/exit points mapped to exercise placeholders (AR-POINT-A through AR-POINT-H).\n- Tanker allocation priorities: (1) Combat Air Patrols (CAP) conducting local air defense over POBs and FOSs; (2) CAS and interdiction strikes supporting assigned LOEs; (3) long-range transits for force redeployment.\n\n3.2 AR Track Procedures and Fuel States.\n- Pre-contact fuel states: Receiver aircraft shall request AR no later than bingo+20 minutes to allow AR scheduling when SATCOM is intermittent. Minimum safe fuel states are defined in CFT-EX Annex: Bingo fuel = mission-specific baseline published in daily ATO-EX; emergency fuel = 10% below published bingo baseline.\n- Controlled breakout: If planned AR cannot be achieved due to contested environment or tanker attrition, the receiver will divert to alternate fuel plan/ELN or execute pre-briefed single-point recovery procedures from the nearest friendly FOS.\n\n3.3 Tanker Self-Protection and Emission Control (EMCON).\n- Tankers will operate under EMCON profiles set in ATO-EX. In high-threat sectors, tankers may require escort or CAP over-watch. When escorted, tanker call signs and escort call signs will be coordinated via CAOC and DECON.\n- Tanker critical sustainment: CAOC will maintain a minimum theater tanker on-station readiness equivalent to one sortie package per primary axis to ensure continuity of long-range fighter presence.\n\n4. COMBAT SEARCH AND RESCUE (CSAR)\n4.1 CSAR Alert Posture and Authority.\n- CSAR posture levels are established in CSAR-EX Annex. Default posture for MDJIR: Alert Condition ALPHA (heightened readiness with staffed CSAR mission sets). Escalation to BRAVO/CHARLIE follows Theater threat assessment.\n- Tactical control of CSAR assets during initial response resides with the Combined Rescue Coordination Center (CRCC); on-scene tactical coordination is handed to the closest Airborne CSAR Coordinator (A-SARCOORD).\n\n4.2 CSAR Tasking and Execution Procedures.\n- CSAR requests will be processed using the standardized PR/ER (Personnel Recovery/Emergency Recovery) format and forwarded through CAOC/CRCC. In degraded comms, use the pre-briefed two-way relay plan: relay via airborne ASW/ISR platform or partner surface unit.\n- Minimum CSAR package composition under contested environment: (a) one rescue helicopter UAS-capable (or manned rotary-wing), (b) dedicated escort fighter or armed UAS, (c) on-scene ISR, (d) airborne tanker as needed for persistence.\n- Deconfliction: CSAR ingress corridors will be annotated in ACO-EX as CSAR-ROUTES with time-phased exclusivity windows to avoid fratricide.\n\n4.3 CSAR Frequencies and Authentication.\n- Primary authentication and beacon protocols for recovery personnel are promulgated in the PR Authentication Appendix. Exercise communications avoid real-world tactical frequencies; instead use EXCON-authenticated crypto callsigns and placeholders. Personnel will carry both radio and visual authentication means.\n\n5. SPACE SUPPORT\n5.1 GPS and PNT Degradation Warnings.\n- Due to replicated adversary counterspace effects in MDJIR, intermittent GPS/PNT degradation is an exercise baseline. CAOC Space Liaison (SPACELINK) will disseminate Space Situational Awareness (SSA) and GPS Integrity Advisories (GIA-EX) via the Space Support Message (SSM-EX) at least every 4 hours or immediately upon significant events.\n- Units must maintain alternate PNT methods: inertial navigation system (INS), map/ground-reference navigation, celestial navigation where trained, and partner-landmark cross-cueing for maritime units.\n\n5.2 SATCOM Prioritization and Contingency.\n- SATCOM capacity is constrained to replicate contested conditions. Prioritization order for SATCOM services: (1) Command & Control (C2) for Combined Force Commander and CAOC, (2) CSAR and lifesaving C2, (3) critical targeting C2, (4) logistic movement orders, (5) routine administrative traffic.\n- Backup SATCOM: When primary wideband SATCOM is degraded, units will transition to protected narrowband SATCOM and HF/LOS networks per COMMS Annex. SATCOM tasking and priority adjustments are controlled by J6/SPACELINK.\n\n5.3 Overhead ISR/OPIR Data Feeds.\n- OPIR (Overhead Persistent Infrared) simulated feeds will be provided to tactical components on a degraded, time-phased basis to replicate contested collection. Feed allocation is by mission priority with CAOC/Space Liaison controlling tasking. Units that require OPIR data for time-sensitive targeting must submit prioritized requests to CAOC using the Time-Sensitive Target (TST) request process.\n- OPIR data dissemination uses the Common Operational Picture (COP)-EX and is subject to intermittent data outages. Units must plan alternative ISR cross-cueing using maritime patrol, AEW, and organic sensors.\n\n6. COMMUNICATIONS\n6.1 Communications Guidance and Resilient Architecture.\n- Communications resilience guidance follows the Theater Communications Resilience Plan (TCRP-EX). Primary C2 links are theater-provided protected IP and MILSATCOM when available; backups include UHF/VHF LOS mesh, HF single-sideband (SSB) for long-range voice, and Allied Tactical Data Links via partner relays.\n- Emplace communications redundancy: Units must be able to operate 48–72 hours without strategic SATCOM reachback using local LOS relays, airborne gateways, and pre-positioned data-bursting schedules.\n\n6.2 Primary and Backup Frequencies/Channels (Sanitized).\n- To prevent disclosure of operationally sensitive lane frequencies, SPINS lists frequency bands and modality priorities rather than exact channel numbers:\n  - Primary C2: Protected MILSATCOM band (X/Ka-band protected service) for commander-to-component C2.\n  - Secondary C2: UHF line-of-sight (satcom fallback) for air control, maritime coordination, and CSAR tasking.\n  - Tertiary: HF-SSB for long-range voice between theater HQ and deployed ELNs when SATCOM is denied.\n  - Data-link: Tactical Data Link family (TADIL/JTIDS-equivalent) for track reporting; connectors should be configured for echeloned relay via airborne and surface nodes.\n  - Voice emergency/guard: Units will monitor pre-briefed exercise guard channels and have an HF emergency watch that supports DSN reachback in degraded environments.\n- Authentication/callsigns: Use EXCON-authenticated tactical callsigns and one-time authentication codes for the duration of MDJIR. No real national crypto keys are distributed in exercise products.\n\n6.3 Messaging and Network Procedures.\n- Emphasize low-probability-of-intercept/low-probability-of-detection (LPI/LPD) techniques: short-burst data, scheduled windows for non-urgent data uplinks, and pre-arranged store-and-forward relay nodes.\n- Email and file exchange: Only use official theater Exchange/Share platforms approved in Annex COMMS-EX. Do not transmit target or force movement details over unsecured commercial SATCOM.\n\n6.4 Electronic Warfare (EW) and Emission Control (EMCON).\n- Theater EMCON levels are published in daily ATO-EX. All units will implement EMCON discipline consistent with mission requirements and deconfliction with airspace control measures. EW offensive actions require prior coordination with CAOC and decomposition in the EW Synchronization Matrix.\n\n7. JOINT PROCEDURES AND REPORTING\n7.1 Daily Battle Rhythm and Reporting.\n- The theater daily battle rhythm: ATO-EX release (T-12 hours), ACO-EX release (T-8 hours), SITREP/COMINT/SSA updates at 4-hour intervals, and commanders’ tactical updates at 2-hour increments during heightened operations.\n- Significant Event Reports (SITREP-E) for contested-space events, major fires, or damage to critical infrastructure must be formatted per the SITREP-E template and transmitted within 30 minutes via secure relay.\n\n7.2 Targeting and Time-Sensitive Targets (TST).\n- Target nomination and approval follow the joint targeting cycle in Annex TARGET-EX. Time-sensitive targeting requests must include PID and collateral risk assessment; if PID is degraded due to contestation, escalate to higher authority.\n\n7.3 Combined/Allied Coordination.\n- Liaison officers (LNOs) from key allies/partners are embedded in CAOC, JFMCC, JFACC, J4, J6, and CRCC. Information sharing adheres to standing bilateral/multilateral intell-sharing agreements; any restrictions are annotated in the Combined Sharing Matrix (CSM-EX).\n\n8. SAFETY, LEGAL, AND ACCOUNTABILITY\n8.1 Legal Oversight and Counsel.\n- Legal counsel (JAG) advisors remain available in CAOC and component HQs to advise on ROE, targeting legal sufficiency, and civilian harm mitigation. All targeting packages require a legal review signature prior to execution unless exigent circumstances are declared.\n\n8.2 Force Protection and OPSEC.\n- Force protection measures are maintained per Annex FP-EX. Operational security (OPSEC) procedures restrict release of operational timelines, unit-level ORBAT, and precise location data in unclassified or partner-shared products without EXCON approval.\n\n9. EXERCISE-SPECIFIC REFERENCES AND PLACEHOLDERS\n9.1 Definitions and Placeholders.\n- All referenced geographic points (POB, FOS, ELN, AR-POINT, GRID-ROZ) are exercise placeholders to be mapped by EXCON. Real-world coordinates and unit identifiers are not included in this SPINS for safety and security.\n9.2 Contacts and Reporting Channels.\n- EXCON will publish the daily contact matrix (EX-CONTACT-EX) including CAOC, CRCC, J6, J4, and LNO paging/relay procedures. Use EXCON-authenticated channels for all SPINS changes.\n\n10. AMENDMENTS, WAIVERS, AND VALIDITY\n10.1 Amendments. This SPINS will be reviewed and, if required, amended every 24 hours or upon significant change in the operational environment. Amendments will be promulgated by CAOC/EXCON.\n10.2 Waivers. Requests for waiver to any SPINS paragraph will be submitted through chain-of-command to CAOC for validation and EXCON approval. Waivers that affect ROE, CSAR posture, or ROZs require higher authority concurrence.\n10.3 Validity.

Electronic emissions limited per ATO EMCON status. Minimum separation from surface shipping 3 NM lateral.\n\n6. KILL BOXES\nKill boxes designate three-dimensional areas where joint fires may be executed with deconfliction measures to expedite engagements. All engagements are simulated under exercise rules unless otherwise annotated as live fire in range control annexes.\n\nGeneral Kill Box Procedures:\n- Engagement authority within each kill box is delegated to the Joint Fires Element (JFE-EX) under JFACC-EX with prescribed weapons release procedures.\n- Aircrews must receive positive clearance from JFE-EX and authentication code for each engagement. Unplanned engagement against emergent threats requires contact with CAOW-EX; if comms denied, default to self-defense ROE.\n- Effects: The following kill boxes are authorized for air-to-surface, surface-to-surface, and anti-surface seaborne fires as designated. All munitions employment within the kill box must abide by simulated collateral constraints in Annex D and be corroborated by joint DCA/EWR assets.\n\n6.1. KILL BOX K-RED-1 (OFFENSIVE AIR-TO-SURFACE)\n- Designation: K-RED-1\n- Coordinates (box corners): NW 21°30.0’N 125°30.0’E; NE 21°30.0’N 126°30.0’E; SE 20°30.0’N 126°30.0’E; SW 20°30.0’N 125°30.0’E\n- Altitudinal limits: Surface — FL460\n- Permitted Effects: Air-to-surface strikes (SIM), UAS attack sorties (SIM), cruise missile simulated launches (SIM).\n- Engagement Rules: Positive two-source targeting (ISR asset + JTAC-EX or JFE-EX) required for high-value target simulation. Weapons release authority: JFACC-EX delegated to On-Scene Commander only when JTAC-EX confirms target and Centre of Gravity (COG) assessment completed. SEAD/DEAD allowed but must coordinate with EW cell and not exceed simulated frequency occupancy.\n\n6.2. KILL BOX K-BLUE-2 (ANTI-SURFACE)\n- Designation: K-BLUE-2\n- Coordinates (box corners): NW 18°50.0’N 130°10.0’E; NE 18°50.0’N 131°00.0’E; SE 17°50.0’N 131°00.0’E; SW 17°50.0’N 130°10.0’E\n- Altitudinal limits: Surface — FL220\n- Permitted Effects: Anti-surface warfare simulated engagements (air-launched and surface-launched), maritime strike coordination.\n- Engagement Rules: Require clearance from Maritime Fires Element (MFE-EX) and positive identification of target vessel by two separate sensors (radar + visual/EO/IR). No simulated missiles to be expended within 10 NM of ELN-EX unless under specific live-fire authorization by ASRC-EX.\n\n6.3. KILL BOX K-GREEN-3 (SUPPRESSION OF IADS / SEAD)\n- Designation: K-GREEN-3\n- Coordinates: Center 20°10.0’N 124°00.0’E with 30 NM radius\n- Altitudinal limits: Surface — FL460\n- Permitted Effects: SEAD/DEAD suppression operations, EW sorties, jamming trial lanes.\n- Engagement Rules: All SEAD/DEAD must coordinate with EW Control Authority (EWCA-EX). Jamming windows will be distributed in 30-minute blocks; CAOW-EX will publish jam codes. Friendly airframes will configure ECCM as defined in the ATO.\n\n6.4. KILL BOX K-YELLOW-4 (JOINT-FORCES INTEGRATED STRIKE)\n- Designation: K-YELLOW-4 (Dynamic)\n- Coordinates: Variable; activated/deactivated by JFACC-EX with 30-minute notice to CAOW-EX and ADC-EX.\n- Altitudinal limits: As promulgated in activation message.\n- Permitted Effects: Multi-domain integrated strike with coordinated maritime, air, cyber, and space-simulated effects.\n- Engagement Rules: Requires pre-coordination in the Mission Planning Cell (MPC-EX), positive fire support coordination measures, and deconfliction brief 60 minutes prior to activation. Cyber-kinetic sequencing must confirm simulated space SATCOM windows to avoid inadvertent fratricide of friendly comms.\n\n7. SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND SAFETY\n7.1. DCA and Friendly Air Defense. Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ-EX) procedures will be strictly enforced around POB-EX and FOS-EX. All participants must maintain updated Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) EX codes. Any aircraft failing to comply will be treated as OPFOR-EX after exercise-prescribed warnings.\n\n7.2. Electronic Warfare and EMCON. EMCON profiles will be set in ATO. EW operations within ROZ-DELTA and K-GREEN-3 require CAOW-EX coordination and publication of permitted emitter windows. Passive navigation and LPI comms strongly encouraged. GPS-denial simulation will be active in ROZ-DELTA and selected corridors; alternate navigation (inertial, TACAN) must be pre-briefed.\n\n7.3. Space/Stratospheric Asset Deconfliction. Simulated satellite outages will be managed by CAOW-EX. High-altitude ISR or stratospheric platforms must coordinate to avoid conflicts with civilian transits. Any would-be real-world overflight of international civil airspace remains outside exercise control and will be coordinated through civil authorities.\n\n7.4. Ordnance and Munitions. All weapons employment during the exercise will be simulated unless otherwise directed by ASRC-EX via a Live Fire Authorization Note. Live munitions use must be scheduled through ASRC-EX and range control and will adhere to host-nation and international safety standards.\n\n7.5. Air-to-Air Refueling (AAR) Emergencies. Emergency AAR procedures (low fuel state declarations) shall follow the Ladder-of-Preferences in Annex E. Primary emergency recovery fields: nearest POB-EX or designated ALT-EX bases. CAOW-EX to issue emergency reallocation with highest priority.\n\n8. REPORTING, AMENDMENTS, AND COORDINATION\n8.1. ACO Amendments. CAOW-EX will publish ACO amendments (01-EX A, B, C…) to reflect dynamic ROZ activation, kill box changes, and AR track updates. Amendments become effective upon broadcast and acknowledgment by primary units.\n\n8.2. Incident and Safety Reporting. All incidents (near misses, losses, unexpected weapons simulation impacts, or simulated fratricide) must be reported immediately to CAOW-EX and ADC-EX and documented in the Exercise Safety Report (ESR) within 12 hours.\n\n8.3. RFI and Deconfliction. Units requiring corridor/ROZ exemptions must submit RFI to ADC-EX no less than 48 hours prior to operation. Time-critical requests accepted under commander’s discretion but require CAOW-EX concurrence.\n\n9. ANNEXES (Reference for detailed procedures)\n- Annex A: UAS/Unmanned Systems Lost-Link Profiles and Minimum Safe Altitudes\n- Annex B: ROZ Activation Calendar and Airdrop Windows\n- Annex C: Live-Fire Range Control and Simulated Munitions Constraints\n- Annex D: Collateral Damage Estimation (CDE) Constraints for Simulated Strikes\n- Annex E: Emergency Recovery Fields and Low-Fuel Ladder-of-Preferences\n- Annex F: Authentication Word Release Schedule and COMSEC Measures\n- Annex G: Airspace Deconfliction Matrix (Cross-Component)\n\n10.

      "content": "MASTER AIR ATTACK PLAN (MAAP)\nOperation: INDOPACOM SHIELD — Multi-Domain Joint Integration and Resilience (MDJIR) (EXERCISE / NOTIONAL)\nTheater: Western Pacific (INDOPACOM) — Exercise-Only, Non-Executable\nMAAP Coverage: Day 1 through Day 15 (01–15 MAR 2026), with daily ATO development driven by this MAAP and updated by AOD/PRF/ISR assessment each ATO cycle.\nSupported Commander: JFC (Exercise)\nSupporting Commander: JFACC (Exercise AOC)\n\nNOTE ON SANITIZATION: This MAAP is intentionally generalized and non-executable. It uses notional operating locations (POB/FOS/Carrier), notional track/station names, and deliberately avoids real-world installation targeting, coordinates, frequencies, or unit-specific tactics. Sortie numbers are for staff training and simulation only.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n1. COMMANDER’S GUIDANCE\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.1 Operational Emphasis (Exercise Effects)\na. Priority of effort is to demonstrate joint force resilience and decision advantage under contested C2: intermittent SATCOM, degraded PNT, datalink interference, and cyber pressure on logistics and unclassified networks.\nb. Air operations will focus on generating repeatable effects aligned to the exercise JIPTL priorities:\n   (1) P1: Rapidly neutralize adversary A2/AD strike and IADS “gates” to open/hold maneuver corridors.\n   (2) P2: Degrade adversary theater ISR/C2 to reduce their targeting cycle and force dithering.\n   (3) P3: Suppress/attrit adversary air and maritime strike capacity (airfields, maritime surface action groups as simulated).\n   (4) P4: Disrupt adversary operational sustainment and deployment tempo (logistics nodes, fuel/munitions distribution as simulated).\n   (5) P5: Protect the force and preserve coalition access: DCA, maritime protection, CSAR posture, and information operations synchronization (exercise injects).\n\n1.2 Desired End State (Exercise)\na. JFACC maintains continuous, resilient C2 to generate ATOs despite comm degradation.\nb. Air component establishes and sustains:\n   (1) Two notional air maneuver corridors through the First Island Chain equivalent (exercise geometry),\n   (2) A persistent DCA umbrella over designated defended assets (DAs),\n   (3) A repeatable kill-chain for time-sensitive targets (TSTs) under degraded PNT/SATCOM, demonstrated in Phase 3.\n\n1.3 Targeting and Fires Restrictions (Exercise / Training)\na. No real-world lethal execution is authorized; all effects are simulated/adjudicated.\nb. No strikes against real-world civilian infrastructure; “dual-use” targets are represented only as simulated target sets with EXCON-approved aimpoints.\nc. Collateral damage constraints are modeled: planners must select aimpoints and fuzing concepts that would keep collateral effects within “LOW” modeled thresholds unless EXCON directs otherwise.\nd. No-cyber impact boundaries: cyber effects will be simulated and restricted to exercise networks/constructs; no real-world systems.\n\n1.4 Risk Tolerance\na. Operational risk to mission accomplishment: MODERATE. Accept localized sortie shortfalls if required to preserve C2 integrity, force protection, and safety-of-flight in degraded nav.\nb. Risk to force (exercise attrition model): LOW to MODERATE. Do not trade away 5th-gen penetration capacity early; prioritize survivability and electronic protection.\nc. Logistics risk: MODERATE. Expect contested fuel and weapons movement; plan for “lean” forward stocks and prioritize high-payoff effects over volume.\n\n1.5 C2 and Communications Intent (Degraded Environment)\na. Primary: mission-type orders and commander’s intent; minimize real-time micromanagement.\nb. Data-link denial is expected; packages must be able to execute with:\n   (1) pre-briefed ROZ/route decision points,\n   (2) inertial nav and timing back-ups,\n   (3) comm-out rejoin and divert procedures.\nc. Airborne C2 will be treated as a contested asset; maintain emission control (EMCON) discipline per daily SPINS and EXCON adjudication.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n2. SORTIE ALLOCATION MATRIX\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2.1 Available Combat Air/ISR Capacity (Notional Force for Exercise)\na. 5th Gen Fighter Squadron (FTR-5G): 24 aircraft at POB-1\n   - Sustainable sortie generation rate (SGR): 1.15 sorties/aircraft/day\n   - Planned daily sorties: 28\nb. 4th Gen Fighter Squadron (FTR-4G): 18 aircraft at POB-2\n   - SGR: 1.30 sorties/aircraft/day\n   - Planned daily sorties: 23\nc. Carrier Air Wing Strike Fighters (CV STRIKE): 36 aircraft at CARRIER-1\n   - SGR: 1.35 sorties/aircraft/day\n   - Planned daily sorties: 49\nd. SIGINT/ISR: 4 large ISR aircraft at POB-1 (strategic/tactical SIGINT)\n   - SGR: 0.75 sorties/aircraft/day\n   - Planned daily sorties: 3\ne. Enabler assumptions (exercise-controlled, not tied to real units):\n   - Tankers: 10–14 sorties/day (varies by phase and weather)\n   - Airborne C2 (AWACS/E-7 class): 4 sorties/day (2 orbits sustained)\n   - Rescue alert (rotary/fixed-wing equivalent): 2–4 sorties/day (posture dependent)\n   - Maritime surface/undersea fires (simulated): available for coordinated effects; not counted as “air sorties”\n\n2.2 Total Planned Daily Sortie Capacity (Phase-Dependent)\na.

allocate by AOD to TST windows.\n\n2.5 Notional Weapon/Loadout Policy (Exercise-Only)\na. Emphasize “effects-based” loads: fewer aimpoints per sortie when PNT is degraded and comm re-attacks are uncertain.\nb. Preserve limited high-end munitions inventory (simulated) for P1/P2 and Phase 3 TST; push P4 with medium confidence aimpoints only when ISR cueing is strong.\nc. When GPS quality is assessed “DEGRADED,” shift to:\n   (1) preplanned visual/INS-aided deliveries (simulated),\n   (2) standoff effects (simulated),\n   (3) non-kinetic suppression where available (exercise).\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n3. PHASE EMPLOYMENT CONCEPT\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3.1 Phase 1 (Days 1–3): Initial Strikes, SEAD, DCA Establishment\nPurpose: Create operational access (simulated), blunt adversary first salvo potential, and establish a stable DCA/HVAA protection architecture while demonstrating C2 resilience.\n\nKey tasks by day:\nDay 1:\n- P1: Execute “Gate Opener” packages against the two highest-payoff A2/AD strike complexes and IADS sector operations nodes (simulated target sets). Objective is to reduce modeled threat rings and open Corridor A.\n- P5: Establish two continuous BARCAPs over primary defended assets; prioritize HVAA escort for tankers and airborne C2.\n- P2: ISR-led mapping of emitter activity; initiate degradation of theater ISR/C2 via simulated node strikes and non-kinetic actions.\nDay 2:\n- P1: Expand SEAD/DEAD to adjacent IADS nodes to hold Corridor A and open Corridor B (second maneuver corridor).\n- P3: Begin OCA sweeps and simulated airfield suppression to reduce adversary sortie generation and maritime strike cueing.\n- P2: Continue suppression of data relay and targeting network; focus on shortening adversary kill-chain.\nDay 3:\n- Consolidate: Re-attack surviving/relocated P1 elements as cued by ISR; transition from “breach” to “hold” operations.\n- Increase P3/P4 only if P1 effects are assessed sufficient (MOE threshold in Section 6).\n\nRules of employment (Phase 1):\n- Do not expend more than 60% of simulated “high-end” stocks before Day 4 unless EXCON inject indicates imminent major adversary strike.\n- Maintain at least one DCA orbit at all times; no “all-in” strike day.\n\n3.2 Phase 2 (Days 4–7): Sustained Operations, Deep Strike\nPurpose: Sustain pressure on adversary operational system while maintaining access and protecting the force; shift weight from “opening” to sustained degradation and interdiction.\n\nOperational approach:\n- P1: Maintain “Suppression Belt” along Corridors A/B; prioritize mobile long-range strike systems and reconstituting IADS nodes (simulated).\n- P2: Intensify attacks on command and sensor fusion nodes (simulated), using ISR to identify redundancy and force “fallback to voice” conditions in adversary construct.\n- P3: Expand maritime strike and counter-air to attrit adversary strike packages before they can mass; use carrier-based aviation for flexible presence.\n- P4: Begin deliberate interdiction of key sustainment lines; aim to create cascading delays (modeled) in fuel and weapons distribution.\n- P5: Reduce routine CAP density slightly, but maintain surge-ready alert and HVAA escort.\n\nDaily rhythm (Phase 2):\n- Two major strike windows/day (one day, one night cycle), with one smaller dynamic window for TST/SCAR.\n- ISR aircraft fly a “long look” every day to maintain continuity of electronic order of battle and cue dynamic re-attacks.\n\n3.3 Phase 3 (Days 8+): Exploitation, Dynamic Targeting\nPurpose: Demonstrate ability to exploit advantage, prosecute dynamic targets, and preserve force while sustaining contested C2.\n\nOperational approach:\n- Shift from fixed target emphasis to dynamic targeting, armed ISR, and SCAR to prosecute time-sensitive targets (mobile launchers, maritime movers, pop-up IADS nodes—simulated).\n- Use sortie surplus (Section 2.4) as a “flex pool” for weather re-attacks, divert-tasked interdiction, and surge DCA in response to adversary raid injects.\n- Emphasize low signature and comm discipline. When SATCOM is denied, execute with preplanned decision points and on-scene commander intent.\n\nPhase 3 success condition:\n- Demonstrated completion of at least one full “degraded kill-chain” per day: detect → identify → task → engage → assess under simulated comm/PNT degradation.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n4. SPACE SUPPORT REQUIREMENTS (EXERCISE)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4.1 PNT (GPS / Multi-Constellation) Support Concept\na. Planning assumption: intermittent jamming/spoofing creates two daily “PNT stress windows” and localized outages near high-value target sets (simulated).\nb. Precision engagement windows (planning guidance):\n- Primary “High-Confidence PNT” windows: 0300Z–0700Z and 1500Z–1900Z (exercise-controlled). Schedule the most PNT-sensitive P1/P2 strikes inside these windows when feasible.\n- “Degraded PNT” windows: 0700Z–1100Z and 1900Z–2300Z. Use for DCA, maritime presence, and less PNT-sensitive interdiction where INS/visual backup is acceptable (simulated).\nc. Mitigations:\n- Require preplanned aimpoint mensuration and inertial navigation cross-check.\n- Include timing gates based on TOT windows rather than continuous updates.\n- Maintain a minimum of two independent timing sources for package lead (exercise procedure).\n\n4.2 SATCOM Allocation by Mission Type (Notional)\na. Protected SATCOM (EHF class) priorities:\n(1) Airborne C2 nodes and AOC reachback continuity\n(2) HVAA coordination for tankers and ISR aircraft\n(3) Package-level retasking for P1/P2 when datalinks are degraded\nb. Tactical SATCOM (UHF/MUOS class) priorities:\n(1) Fighter package coordination when LOS is blocked\n(2) CSAR alert coordination and survivor communications (exercise)\n(3) Maritime coordination for dynamic targeting\nc. Wideband SATCOM priorities:\n(1) ISR product dissemination to the AOC (when available)\n(2) ATO/ACO/SPINS distribution to forward nodes\nd. Contested SATCOM mitigation:\n- Assume one wideband path degraded at any time; plan alternate routing via protected SATCOM for critical C2 messages and use store-and-forward for non-critical products.\n- Daily SPINS will designate “comms minimums” and authentication procedures for comm restoration.\n\n4.3 ISR / OPIR Support Schedule (Exercise)\na. OPIR (launch detect) support is assumed continuous but with reporting delays during contested comm windows.\nb. Daily ISR deck (baseline):\n- 1 SIGINT/ISR sortie during the primary strike window (0300Z–0700Z) focused on P1/P2 cueing and emitter mapping.\n- 1 SIGINT/ISR sortie during the secondary window (1500Z–1900Z) focused on maritime/air track correlation and post-strike assessment.\n- 1 SIGINT/ISR sortie “swing” scheduled by AOD for highest-need: either dynamic targeting in Phase 3 or re-attack cueing in Phase 2.\nc. Collection priorities:\n(1) Emitter geolocation and identification to support SEAD/DEAD adjudication\n(2) Maritime mover detection and classification (simulated)\n(3) Post-strike indications for BDA modeling (communications shifts, emitter silence, rerouting)\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n5. FLOW PLAN\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.1 Airspace and Routing Construct (Notional)\na. Two primary maneuver corridors (Corridor A and Corridor B) defined in the ACO with time-phased activation; corridors are opened by Phase 1 P1 effects and held by continuous suppression.\nb. Package assembly areas:\n- ASSEMBLY WEST (for carrier-based packages)\n- ASSEMBLY EAST (for land-based packages)\nc. ROZs (restricted operating zones) will be published daily; dynamic ROZ establishment is authorized via airborne C2 if comm allows.\n\n5.2 Tanker Flow and Tracks (Notional, No Coordinates)\na. Tanker tracks (all notional; geometry published in ACO as track boxes):\n- TRACK ALPHA (forward, high-demand): supports penetration/escort and time-on-station for CAPs\n- TRACK BRAVO (mid): supports strike packages prior to corridor entry\n- TRACK CHARLIE (rear): recovery/emergency/divert support\nb. Tanker sortie allocation by 6-hour period (Phase 1 peak / Phase 2 steady / Phase 3 flexible):\nTime Block 0000Z–0600Z:\n- Phase 1: 4 tanker sorties (2 ALPHA, 1 BRAVO, 1 CHARLIE)\n- Phase 2: 3 tanker sorties (1 ALPHA, 1 BRAVO, 1 CHARLIE)\n- Phase 3: 2–3 tanker sorties (0–1 ALPHA depending on TST; 1 BRAVO; 1 CHARLIE)\nTime Block 0600Z–1200Z:\n- Phase 1: 3 tanker sorties (1 ALPHA, 1 BRAVO, 1 CHARLIE)\n- Phase 2: 3 tanker sorties (1 ALPHA, 1 BRAVO, 1 CHARLIE)\n- Phase 3: 2 tanker sorties (1 BRAVO, 1 CHARLIE)\nTime Block 1200Z–1800Z:\n- Phase 1: 4 tanker sorties (2 ALPHA, 1 BRAVO, 1 CHARLIE)\n- Phase 2: 4 tanker sorties (1–2 ALPHA, 1 BRAVO, 1 CHARLIE)\n- Phase 3: 3 tanker sorties (1 ALPHA for dynamic window, 1 BRAVO, 1 CHARLIE)\nTime Block 1800Z–2400Z:\n- Phase 1: 3 tanker sorties (1 ALPHA, 1 BRAVO, 1 CHARLIE)\n- Phase 2: 3 tanker sorties (1 ALPHA, 1 BRAVO, 1 CHARLIE)\n- Phase 3: 2 tanker sorties (1 BRAVO, 1 CHARLIE)\nc. Tanker demand management:\n- Strike packages receive refuel priority during corridor transit windows.\n- DCA CAPs are planned with one scheduled top-off per 2.5–3.0 hours.\n- In “tanker short” conditions, reduce P4 first, then P3, while preserving P1/P2 and minimum DCA.\n\n5.3 Sortie Flow per 6-Hour Period (Representative Daily Flow)\nThe following depicts a representative Phase 2 day (Days 4–7). Phase 1 shifts more weight to 0000Z–0600Z and 1200Z–1800Z for opening/holding; Phase 3 increases “flex” in 1200Z–2400Z for dynamic targeting.\n\n0000Z–0600Z (Primary Strike Window / High-Confidence PNT):\n- P1 “Hold/Breach” packages: 10–12 fighter sorties\n- P2 node degradation packages: 6–8 fighter sorties + 1 ISR\n- P5 HVAA escort + BARCAP: 10–12 fighter sorties\n- Enablers: 1 AWACS + 3–4 tankers\n\n0600Z–1200Z (Transition / Degraded PNT):\n- P3 sweep / maritime presence: 10–12 fighter sorties\n- P5 BARCAP sustainment: 8–10 fighter sorties\n- P4 limited interdiction (only if ISR-cued): 4–6 fighter sorties\n- Enablers: 1 AWACS + 3 tankers\n\n1200Z–1800Z (Secondary Strike Window / High-Confidence PNT):\n- P3 maritime strike / OCA: 10–14 fighter sorties\n- P4 deliberate interdiction: 6–8 fighter sorties\n- P2 follow-up / re-attack: 6–8 fighter sorties + 1 ISR\n- Enablers: 1 AWACS + 4 tankers\n\n1800Z–2400Z (Dynamic Window / Recovery):\n- P1 re-attack (as cued): 4–6 fighter sorties (Phase 2) / 2–4 (Phase 3)\n- P4 armed recce / SCAR: 6–8 fighter sorties (Phase 3 emphasis)\n- P5 night BARCAP and alert launches: 6–8 fighter sorties\n- Enablers: 1 AWACS + 2–3 tankers + CSAR alert posture\n\n5.4 AWACS Coverage Rotation (Notional)\nObjective: sustain two overlapping orbits in Phase 1–2, then one continuous plus one surge orbit in Phase 3.\n\na. Orbit structure:\n- ORBIT SKYLOOK-1 (forward battle management, corridor control, CAP management)\n- ORBIT SKYLOOK-2 (rear/mid, recovery control, tanker management, comm relay)\nb. AWACS sorties/day:\n- Phase 1: 4 sorties/day (2 per orbit, ~6 hours on-station each with overlap)\n- Phase 2: 4 sorties/day (same, with increased comm relay function)\n- Phase 3: 3–4 sorties/day (one continuous orbit; second orbit surged during TST windows or adversary raid injects)\nc. Emissions and survivability:\n- Use minimum required emissions; rely on mission-type orders and procedural control if datalinks are degraded.\n- If threat to HVAA increases (exercise inject), pull SKYLOOK-1 aft and increase fighter escort rather than cancel the orbit.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n6. ASSESSMENT CRITERIA (MEASURES OF EFFECTIVENESS)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAssessment will be conducted daily by the AOC Strategy Division and ISR/Targeting Effects Team using exercise adjudication, simulated BDA, comm logs, and mission reports. MOEs below drive next-day MAAP adjustments and ATO apportionment.\n\nP1 (Destroy A2/AD strike complexes / IADS “gates”)\nMOE-P1.1: Percent reduction in modeled threat coverage along Corridors A/B (goal: ≥60% by end of Day 3; ≥75% by end of Day 7).\nMOE-P1.2: Number of adversary long-range strike “salvos” disrupted or delayed (goal: disrupt/delay ≥2 major events in Phase 1; ≥1/day thereafter as injected).\nMOE-P1.3: SEAD/DEAD effectiveness rate (simulated): ≥70% of tasked emitters suppressed during strike windows.\nMOE-P1.4: Blue loss exchange ratio in contested corridor operations (goal: maintain favorable modeled ratio; trigger review if losses exceed “MODERATE” threshold).\n\nP2 (Degrade theater ISR/C2 / targeting network)\nMOE-P2.1: Increase in adversary kill-chain timeline (goal: +50% by Day 7; +75% by Day 10).\nMOE-P2.2: Reduction in adversary track quality/continuity (goal: persistent “gaps” sufficient to force adversary to rely on less-accurate targeting during ≥2 daily periods).\nMOE-P2.3: Friendly C2 continuity under SATCOM loss: ATO execution success rate ≥85% despite comm degradation; critical retasks delivered within planned windows when required.\nMOE-P2.4: ISR-to-attack cycle time for preplanned targets (goal: validated/updated target status available within 12 hours for re-attack decisions).\n\nP3 (Neutralize adversary air/maritime strike capacity)\nMOE-P3.1: Reduction in adversary sortie generation capacity (modeled) (goal: ≥40% by Day 7; ≥55% by Day 15).\nMOE-P3.2: Maritime strike suppression: number of simulated hostile maritime strike attempts prevented or blunted (goal: ≥1 significant disruption per 48 hours during Phase 2–3).\nMOE-P3.3: Air superiority indicators: maintain DCA intercept success rate ≥80% during raid injects; limit adversary “leakers” to low single digits as adjudicated.\n\nP4 (Disrupt operational logistics / sustainment)\nMOE-P4.1: Modeled fuel and munitions throughput reduction (goal: ≥25% by Day 7; ≥40% by Day 15).\nMOE-P4.2: Induced operational pauses or reroutes (goal: ≥1 significant pause/reroute event every 72 hours beginning Day 4).\nMOE-P4.3: Re-attack efficiency: ≥60% of re-attacks allocated only after ISR confirmation of continued target value (avoid “wasted” sorties in contested ISR).\n\nP5 (Defend / preserve force and access)\nMOE-P5.1: Defended asset integrity: maintain ≥95% DA availability (modeled), with rapid recovery from attack injects.\nMOE-P5.2: HVAA survival and mission continuity: tankers/AWACS/ISR complete ≥90% of planned on-station time.\nMOE-P5.3: CSAR posture effectiveness (exercise): alert response timelines met ≥90% (scramble-to-airborne, ingress readiness, comm plan execution).\nMOE-P5.4: Sortie generation resilience: maintain fighter MC rate and SGR within 10% of plan despite contested logistics/cyber injects.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nMAAP EXECUTION NOTES (FOR DAILY ATO DEVELOPMENT)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA. Apportionment “Floor” (do not drop below without JFACC approval):\n- P1 + P2 combined: minimum 30 fighter sorties/day during Phases 1–2; minimum 24/day during Phase 3.\n- P5 DCA/HVAA: minimum 18 fighter sorties/day all phases (CAP + escort combined), surge-capable on 2-hour notice.\n\nB. Apportionment “Flex” (first to trade when constrained):\n- P4 is the primary give-back during tanker shortages or PNT degradation.\n- P3 is second give-back unless adversary raid injects indicate increased maritime/air threat.\n\nC. Daily Timing Anchors (planning anchors; adjust per weather/EXCON):\n- Major strike windows: 0300Z–0700Z and 1500Z–1900Z.\n- Dynamic/TST window: 1800Z–2400Z (Phase 3 emphasis).\n- DCA CAP changeovers planned every 3–4 hours with tanker support.\n\nD. Degraded Comms Branch Plan (execute when SATCOM/datalink is denied):\n- Packages proceed per prebriefed decision points with “continue/abort” triggers tied to threat and fuel.\n- Abort criteria emphasize force preservation and recovery to alternate fields/sites (exercise-designated) without requiring real-time clearance beyond procedural control.\n\nEND OF MAAP (EXERCISE / NOTIONAL)",
